"Pegasus-Airlines","Terrible flight.","The worst airline, which I selected for journey during my about 10 years experience in flights. The flight was delayed for about 2:30 h from Ankara to Istanbul. The company cheats about time of delay and boarding, because they wanted to avioid any reimbursement. Typical rubbish activity.",10,2023,1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Very underrated","Me and the wife were booked on Pegasus airlines for our holiday to Turkey with love holidays and after reading the reviews was not expecting much.We were over the moon with our experience check in and bag drop 5 minutes flight on time going out and coming back 25 minutes check in and bag drop and flight on time. Staff all very pleasant and helpful and I would rate it the best budget airline I have travelled with.",10,2023,5
"Pegasus-Airlines","BAD BAD BAD BAD","Worst airlines EVER! Seriously, IN MY WHOLE LIFE, I have never spoken to a customer service representative as rude as theirs! They are beyond rude and insensitive. They don't even try to help or listen, and they speak in a sarcastic way, as if they are happy you have problems with your flight!",10,2023,1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Horrible service and no any support for passengers","I didn’t ever been in bigger trouble with my road then with this company!
Because they’ve changed gates of departure at last moment, so at my ticket it was written older information. And I missed my flight. No any support from company. Woman from information desk of this company was not at work place for an hour and it was a lot people in queue only to this company. And after waiting they didn’t help to return money or to give new tickets!",10,2023,1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Lost baggage","It was a horrible trip I have experienced.
The seat was too uncomfortable
And worth thing is that after a week, I haven't received my baggage yet unfortunately no one is responding to me.
Don't waste your money on this funking damn airline 🤬🤬🤬🤬",10,2023,1
"Pegasus-Airlines","No customer service provided on long haul flight","£500+ for 5 hours of poor customer service

This is hands down the worst airline I've ever down with.

1. The seating gave me 5 hours of back pain.
2. We received no complimentary food even though it was 5 hour flight.
3. The air con was so overpowered that I left the flight with a cold.
4. They wouldn't even give us free water.
5. There's no space to put your things in the seat in front of you like every other airline.

What were we paying 500+ for exactly?

I've never been so uncomfortable for so long on a flight. even if it's economy, you need to provide free drinking water if the flight is so long, do better.

Tips if you're unfortunate enough to fly with Pegasus Airlines.

1. Bring your own food and liquids/water
2. Prepare for strong air con
3. Bring own entertainment
4. Get an aisle seat because you'll need to stretch your legs due to lack of legroom",10,2023,1

"Pegasus-Airlines","Great airline , faultless","We had a great flight , the airport lets you tag your own bags , the process is super easy and efficient.
My boyfriend had a sudden onset of sickness and the crew were amazing . They gave him sick bags and gave us a full row to ourselves so he could lay down and sleep. Faultless airline",10,2023,5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Awful AVOID AT ALL COSTS","WARNING - DO NOT FLY WITH THESE COWBOYS!!

I booked a Pegasus flight with Loveholidays when I booked a trip to Turkey, I saw there were flights with Pegasus and they were fairly cheap, I had never heard of them before so I was a little skeptical but boy oh boy do I wish I checked the review for this poor excuse of a company first.

On our way to our destination our flights were delayed over an hour, no apology was made just expected to just deal with it.

On the actual flight, it was extremely uncomfortable there’s no way of relaxing whatsoever.

For 2 sandwiches and 2 bottles of water it cost 20 Great British Pounds!!! - the sandwiches they give you go out of date on the same day and they don’t accept Apple Pay because they’re clearly stuck in 2003.

They charge more for British cash than euros which is insane as the British pound is worth more, absolute CROOKS!!

They promote that they have ‘wifi’ when the only thing you can connect to is their own website to see the status of the flight, you can’t go on any other website and if you want to play games on THEIR website it’s an extra 4 euros for ‘pReMiUM’

Again, our flights home were delayed by an hour due to their consistent lack of contumacy.

Overall straight 0/10 do not recommend at all, worst flight I’ve been on theyre level with Ryanair.

Do not put yourself through this in life, like they say “you buy cheap, you get cheap”

Never again!!!!!",10,2023,1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Strange baggage rules and poor food","Check in not possible online and had to check a bag weighing 4.5 kgs at check in as I also had a laptop bag. Did not have to on my return flight, so much for Pegasus policy. Pre ordered food and it was so dry and I then had to purchase a drink. Ailse seat which was comfortable at extra cost. Landed on time and small bag arrived quickly",10,2023,3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Terrible airline","I booked 00:20 flight on 15th of September l went to airport and they said you should’ve been here last night and don’t blame yourself so many others do the same mistake because they became confused to select the right date. I haven’t received even a dime from them for missed flight. Unfortunately my return flight also was booked by pegasus. And it was my first flight with them. It was definitely the most terrible experience I’ve had with an airline.
They charged me 253£ for 23kg extra baggage. During the flight they were selling food and drinks and didn’t give passengers even one bottle of water for free.
When I received my bags in the airport one of them was crushed. Since then I’ve tried to reach them but they don’t have any email address and contact number seems to be wrong.
Simply I won’t fly with them ever again.
And make sure no one around me does it as well.",10,2023,1
"Pegasus-Airlines","SAW airport the busiest single runway airport in the world and Pegasus main hu","The airport is incredibly budget-oriented, giving off an appearance of wear and tear. Pegasus has selected SAW as its main hub, which is known as the busiest single-runway airport in the world. During my layover there, I encountered a considerable wait due to an extensive line of airplanes awaiting their turn on the sole runway.

Upon finally boarding the aircraft, we found ourselves stuck in a traffic jam on the tarmac for an entire hour, moving only 10 feet every 5 minutes. To make matters worse, after a total of 1.5-hour delay on the runway and the gate, when I requested water (since my personal supply had been depleted – an amount that should have been sufficient for a 3-hour flight), the crew actually charged 2 EUR for water.

Given this experience, I would strongly advise avoiding SAW Airport altogether.",10,2023,2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Don't expect any help or service","We had to wait a long time in a corridor with bad air to board the plane. Two kids got sick on the plane, there were no sick bags for them and the crew was absolutely no help. They had no cleaning supplies, other passangers helped by giving wet wipes and plastic bags.
Horrible airline for families but then again, if you buy cheap, you get cheap.",10,2023,1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Zero","26th September 2023 I took flight from Berlin to Dubai. My hand baggage was taken by air attendant before catching the flight. After that I never saw my baggage. Till date after so many efforts they lost my bag and don’t reply to my emails of calls. I had valuable things in it.
I’m going to the German court to settle the matter.",10,2023,1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Absolutely avoid.","I travelled for weight loss surgery. Please remember this.

We got to saw airport and had assistance through the airport (3 days post op). The assistance at the actual airport was faultless.

However, boarding the plane was something I have never experienced.
We were loaded on to the front of the plane and had to get to thr back row WITHOUT help as they didn't want to help.

Immediately boarding the NASTY stewardess was very rude to us asking why we needed assistance. I have never in my life been asked why I need assistance. She asked loudly in front of everyone.

She didn't believe me when I told her I had surgery and asked for proof!
My proof was under the plane in my suitcase with my medication (needles). She harassed me for 20 minutes I explained if you go get my bag I will show you.

She even asked to see my scars. IN FRONT OF EVERYONE. It was so humiliating. So I showed her and she was just very nasty about the whole thing telling me I wasn't smart to leave my papers under the plane.

I PAID for back row window seats and people were in our seats, the stewards didn't care and did not ask them to move either. I did not get a refund for this.

Now. There is a family to my left on the same row as me and the row infant to my left. The kid who is about 8 kept trying to kick me and no body did anything at all. His legs were hanging in the aisle and the staff and other flyers kept bumping I to me (I JUST HAD SURGERY) instead of asking this brat to move his legs and behave.

I needed the toilet and there was a man on the back row slumped across two seats and the whole aisle I nearly fell trying to climb over this large man. I asked the staff to move him and they tutted me.

Getting off the plane.
We were made to wait 40 minutes foe the lift to come get us, we were on there whilst the cleaners got on! They just left us. They did not care.

They made it very clear they did not care about a complaint. Now I know why. I made a complaint and they did not care in the slightest. So that's why their staff behave like animals and treat people with zero respect. They can get away with it.

I was humiliated on this airline and there was no repercussions.

I asked for a refund of my seats as we didn't get to sit in our seats because other people took them and they said no.

They said they investigated and there's nothing to report. I am beyond disgusted with this line and would not recommend at all.",10,2023,1

"Pegasus-Airlines","Terrible airline","Terrible arline ever. Always with delays, rudeness and carelessness. My last 4 flights with them had hours of delays. For ex they say its only one hour then they make you stand in the boarding line for 2 hours with no explanation or giving estimate of take off. Loke really rude and insulting.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Opodo/Pegasus scum bags","We bought tickets on Opodo company that linked with “pegasus”. Scam that they are running cooperatively is works this way. You buy a ticket you fly to your destination on the way back 4 hours before flight pegasus will cancel your flights and they will not refund and never notify you in time. Than they will sell your ticket back to you on double price. This scum bags need to be jailed and company have to be arrested. I wonder if government have any income out of that as they do not do much to solve this frauds. Please never use opodo or pegasus. When ringing them they will verbally abuse you swear at you and laugh at you. UK government needs to take step to demolish this scam bags other vise people will take action them selves and lots of pakis working on pegasus will get heart if not executed.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst trip in my life","If you want to be humiliated by junior staff, then you should probably fly with this airline. When I told the woman working at the counter that I wanted to complain about her and asked her to tell me her first and last name, she hid her badge. Then we started having a conflict, she called airport security and told the guards that I had attacked her. Then they invited the senior staff of Pegasus Airlines. And the boss said that she trusts the words of her subordinate, and not me (I have no doubt about this, they cover for each other). Despite the fact that my husband witnessed and confirmed my words, it turned out that the boorish and aggressive behavior of the service staff is normal, and all the blame is shifted to the client.

I remember some passengers easily missed their flight because of the airline delay for 1 hour. I was lucky because my final destination was Frankufrt.

"Pegasus-Airlines","PEGASUS DROPS THE WHEELCHAIR PASSENGER INTO A CORNER AND LEAVES THE PERSON FOR EXTENDED TIME ALONE AND UNATTENDED","My wife and I flew from Bodrum to Istanbul Sabiha Gökçen Airport with Pegasus Airlines on September 10, 2023, with flight PC2255. Due to my health condition, I needed a wheelchair. At Bodrum Airport, 4.5 minutes after I called, the officer appeared in front of me with a wheelchair and I was amazed by this service. The flight was on time. After a super nice landing, they took me down last in a wheelchair, as per the rule, and left me in a hall at Sabiha Gökçen Airport. They said others would arrive in two or three minutes. They took the wheelchair and left. There was no one there except the cleaners. We asked various officials passing by how they could help. They all had excuses. “We do not look at that company etc.”. Meanwhile, after about 35 minutes, another wheelchair came across. He started to wait for his passenger. He said that he was not working to Pegasus and that he did not know anything about our subject. So we were forgotten.
There is no crowd at all. Does this person need water? No one asks what he does or what he needs. There is no number to call. No, there is nothing and no one.
They finally came with wheelchair. Although we passed through quite quickly, when we reached the luggage area, there was no one else but our luggage. One or two luggages were being collected in the adjacent belt.
So what's the point of taking me down and leaving me in a remote corner where you don't know who will come and when. Why can't the esteemed person who took me from the aircraft go all the way to the end (""sir, this is the procedure"" is not enough) or stop and wait until the other one comes to pass hand. He leaves me all alone and walks away (he talked outside with his friends for a while, so he didn't have much 'other work').
This ground handling service from Pegasus (or its business partner for that matter) gets a zero from me.

Okay, the next same flight was supposed to be tomorrow which is already today.
I come to the airport and the flight was 1h15m delayed, with my 2h layover in Istanbul I could not make it on time, there’s no chance.
I run to the gate, ask the woman working there what can I do and if I can catch that flight, she goes “the plane is gone, the next one is in 3 days, go to the passport control and they will send you to the hotel”
I was terrified, the second time I’m trying to get home and because of the air company I just can’t make it happen.
Many people who had the same flight with the layover in Istanbul were late just because of Pegasus.
We all went to the information desk and they promised to help. The only thing they did is they changed our tickets to the next flights. BUT 3 DAYS COME ON!!!
It was not my fault in any possible way and because of Pegasus I can’t go to work for 5 days.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Horrible, avoid at ALL costs.","Took a flight from Marseille to Beirut via Istanbul-Sabiha for vacation. First to note was that the crew on the first flight was incredibly rude, literally, a kid told a FA ""Bonjour"" and she mocked him... The flight to Istanbul was ok though there was no in-flight entertainment, barely any legroom and food was very expensive. Trouble started once we arrived to SAW. Flight was delayed and I missed it (my mistake though), but there was no last call for that flight which was very peculiar while other flights had, even Pegasus flights. Going to the information counter was just hell. Not only did the company representatives barely speak a word of English but they took my passport and ticket and just waited... For what ? no clue. There was another flight to Beirut an hour after I had missed mine, I asked them to check for availability and I'm willing to pay whatever to be on it. They didn't even check, just put the passport on the counter and totally ignored me despite asking them multiple times and telling them that it was urgent, UNTIL AN HOUR LATER when the second flight was supposed to take off. Thinking I was saved and things were gonna get better alas they made me go through border police and left me all by myself without any support at the airport, not even giving me some instructions on what to do next, just putting me in front of the border police queue and going. Eventually I had to pay an additional 800€ to get to my destination ON ANOTHER (more expensive) AIRLINE switching to IST airport and getting stranded in Turkey for a total of 18 hours. Conclusion? They treat people like cattle, they don't care about their customers and don't even bother to try to.
Avoid this airline at ALL costs, if you care about your mental health just take another airline and spare yourself, it isn't worth ruining your entire voyage.",8,"2023",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Terrible airline ever!!!! Please do not chose this one.","The most disgusting and unprofessional airline I have ever experienced. The staff is simply terrible, they should be taught atleast basic level of customer services.

The flight was supposed to fly ay 525am. None of the staff bothered to come to the gate. The automatic system even started flashing gate is closed for boarding, all customers were confused and were in tension. No one came to tell that the flight is delayed. This is stupid, how could you be so unprofessional. You should inform customers. Finally at 525am a person came, when i asked is there anyone to assist with the flight, he carelessly replied go back wait 20min we will start - like seriously. He was like he did not care at all. Even if I would not have asked, no one have bothered to say anything. The boarding finally started at 550am. Pathetic experience.

WOULD NEVER EVER AND EVER AND EVER CHOSE PEGASUS.",8,"2023",1

"Pegasus-Airlines","Great low cost airline","After reading all this comments I was so scared to go in Pegasus but actually I had no problem with them the staff is friendly,the seats aren’t that bad we should always keep in mind that its low cost and they’re doing amazing job for the money you’re paying.I didn’t encounter any problem.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Stay away at every cost! Worst experience!!","The worst Airlines ever! It was 2 hours delayed Departing from Manchester to Istanbul, and when we finally started moving it suddenly stopped on the runway as the ground crew didn't put the luggage on! After 3 hours we took off. Our arrival time was 8. 40 pm we arrived at 12.00 am. Luggage took another hour to come out! This is nothing coming back to Manchester our flight was delayed 4 hours and our luggage is still there as the crew didn't remember to put the luggage in! Still waiting for luggage to come after 2 days 😡. Everyone on the plane was angry and not a single person had good thing to say about the airline. Don't even get me started on the staff! Absolutely rude and treated people as of they were children. I didn't have little children but I felt really sorry for families with babies and toddlers.
Never ever again. They say it's budget airlines but it cost is the same as normal airlines, not worth the money😡
They better fly our luggage otherwise they'll be paying 70 odd families for their luggage.

When I tried to ask the representatives about the status of the flight after receiving no information for 2 hours other than updates via the digital display, I was completely ignored by the snobby representatives. One representative was extremely rude, she refused to speak to me, was mumbling something without looking at me, and signaled with her hand for me to go away. I've never been spoken to in such a manner. I understand the delays were obviously not her fault but to think that you can speak someone like that, someone who has paid for services is beyond me. What's more is that we weren't able to pick up our checked-in luggage. We were given no information about this so we had to wait for ages for our luggage to arrive. It is only when we enquired after a long delay that we were told it won't arrive now and will be delivered to a chosen address instead.

Not recommend to fly with Pegasus airlines.",8,"2023",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","The WORST!","Had an extremely disappointing experience flying with Pegasus. As a former airline staff member, I was shocked by the level of service. The flight was delayed by a staggering 1.5 hours, even though the staff initially assured us it would only be a 20-minute delay. Upon arrival, the baggage was inexplicably left next to the plane for 57 minutes before finally being moved indoors. Unfortunately, there was no assistance or willingness to help from any of the staff members. I strongly recommend avoiding this airline at all costs.",8,"2023",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst airline I have ever flown by FAR","This airline is an absolute joke through and through. They checked in our luggage, then delayed our flight and changed the gate without announcing anything. As a matter of fact, when we asked the lady at the gate, she told us that our flight was further delayed at the same gate, and that we needed to wait for another plane to land before our flight would take off. Little did we know, the flight was actually moved to the other side of the airport, and was about to take off. By the time we got to the customer service, we found a line of at least 40 people all facing similar issues with delays and missed flights due to terrible organization coming from different scheduled flights. They would not offer any reimbursement and basically told us all to go screw ourselves, along with other people including elderly who were sleeping on the floor with no spare clothes since their luggage was checked in. Even when you are on the airplane, the food is extremely subpar, the chairs are uncomfortable, and the most basic of basic things like the chair reclining or the arm rest being adjustable are not available. Considering that I am quite a frequent traveler, I have never experienced any airline with such a low bar and am appalled at how low of a standard this airline has set. Overall, will never be putting my money into this terrible airline ever again.",8,"2023",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Decent Airlines","I have used Pegasus Airlines before but only during internal flights within Turkey and had no issues. This time I booked with them for international flights to Turkey and Italy and my experience was positive. The planes departed on time on each occasion, seats were comfortable and spacious. The only drawback was that I paid extra for the entertainment system but unfortunately it didn't work, it didn't connect and when I asked one of the cabin crew members he didn't really acknowledge the situation.",8,"2023",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst Service and rude staff","Recently travelled from Sharjah to London Stansted airport. This is the first time I have travelled through this airlines. Here is the detailed update.

1. Flight from Sharjah was delayed by 3 hours. During that time AC was not working, we were made to sit inside the Aircraft and we were getting grilled inside the aircraft.

2. Reasons specified for the delay was horrible. Everytime new reason when we asked about delay.

3. We missed the connecting flight. For which we were given a meal coupon. When I asked the Airline staff on how to redeem this, they were getting annoyed. They were not in a position to explain. I felt like as if I am a beggar. Really Really Rude behaviour.

4. As airline staff were not helping on how to use this meal coupon, we asked some fellow passengers. when I went to a restaurant, they said this coupon is not valid at all. We went to all the 4 restaurants, everyone gave the same answer. Not sure who were the cheaters here.

Final conclusion, even though this is a budget airline, I would never recommend this airline. If you have no other option than booking thing, get ready for the worst.",8,"2023",1

Bad service, I faced a strange situation, I saw some people before we boarded the plane that they were sleeping in place of 6 people, I asked the staff to solve the issue because the elderly and children do not find empty seats because of them, they refused to help under the pretext that this is a place and we have to save them. And many situations happened with my friends that they made them pay not small amounts because of the extra weight, or that the bag had wheels, so he had to pay more.

"Pegasus-Airlines","DO NOT FLY Pegasus","I must prevent what happened to me from happening to anyone else, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES fly with Pegasus. It's NOT WORTH IT. I was on a connecting flight to Istanbul and then to Stanstead travelling alone. I and 25 other passengers were nervous to see our first flight was delayed by an hour which didn't seem a problem but then was delayed longer. By the time we landed in Istanbul, we ran in a panic to our second gate. I managed to get there with 10 mins to spare horrified to see it was closed 20 mins ahead of schedule.

Most of us unable to speak Turkish tried to get help on what we could do next. I tried talking to over 12 staff members, but none even looked me in the eye or listened, I began to have a panic attack as I was forced out of the airport by a staff member who said it wasn't his job. If it wasn't for a fellow passenger that spoke Turkish I a young woman would be out on the street with no knowledge where I was in the middle of the night with no currency.

We ran from desk to desk with staff ignoring a majority of us, with tears and panic no staff even gave me a sympathetic eye and two even said it was our fault to our lovely translator who was poorly mistreated by a man at the sales desk throwing her passport at her. after hours of running around finally one overworked woman helped us get vouchers for a hotel and flight that would be 12 hour later.

To our dismay, the hotel was only for 4 hours when our flight was 12 hours after we were meant to be home. and when we arrived it will be filled with escorts, and banging through the few hours we had.

This delay process we understand it's not the staff's fault but their behaviour was atrocious and awful. they didn't want to do their jobs or even offer a smile. I tried my Turkish which is poor but they didn't even say hello to me back. This whole process would have been acceptable if any of the staff were kind enough to say this is what will happen as we ran around the airport for 3 hours asking for help or guidance. this whole time my partner tried the 24/7 phone helpline from Cyprus and they didn't answer after he called 11 times. Other passengers like myself had plans that were destroyed by the airline's lack of planning, the most helpful member of staff was from ANOTHER AIRLINE.

So to summarise, poor planning, blaming passengers for that poor planning and delays. closing gates early, rude staff, not even bothering to put our bags on the next plane originally, and the bare minimum of a hotel.

oh and for fun when we got back the bags crashed on the belt.

I'm still so angry by the treatment I and my fellow passengers received so implore you DO NOT RISK IT Do not fly with staff who don't care enough, and don't fly with this airline that only has reviews in the form of the phone line that won't pick up. It's for a reason. choose a safe option.",8,"2023",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","My first flight with Pegasus","After reading so many horrible reviews I was so afraid of what could happen but I can tell you, from boarding it was just an amazing experience, everything went smoothly and it was very pleasant (even though I was scared in the beginning).",8,"2023",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Unligitimate and no respect","👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻

Hello, I write this in English so that it can get read by many people as possible, as I believe everyone need to take a gimpse of this airline company before deciding to book a flight through them.

Today on the 9th august 2023 I flought with Pegasus from Cologne/Bonn Airport in Germany to Sabiha Gocken Airport in Istanbul, Turkey and then from Sabiha Gockrn Airport to Beirut Rafic Hariri Airport in Lebanon.

As I angrily sit now in the airplane from Istanbul to Beirut, I write this review because no one should be treated in such a demeaning way.

What happened today is that the first airplane's departure from Germany to Turkey was about an hour delayed, the second plane from Turkey was 50 minutes delayed. This is not my first flight with Pegasus, I can say that about all my previous flights with them were also delayed in different time.

BUT this can happen with all airplanes and this is not what made me and many other passengers angry. Today we as passengers were asked on the flight from Istanbul to Beirut to pay 40€ extra for each bag we carry, no mattet what it is. The problem with that, is that we came with the same airflight company in the first flight from Germany to Turkey, and we were not demanded to pay, so who can explain the difference in rules since we are talking about the samd company, two flights, same day. The way the workers were speaking with us was totallu unploite, loud, hateful and I would go also so far and say also racisstic. They were asking for 40€ for each bag, also when it is a plastic bag with pair of shoes, yelling the mafia gangs with no respect to passengers or the airport or what they as a flighting company should represent. I saw what happened with other passngers from mistreatment when they tried to argue with this out-of-a-sudden newly found rule only in Pegasus in Sabiha Gockan airport, so I just paid the 40€ and I was also screamed at, what made me really angy is that I did not get any receipt, what made me question the legetimacy of what they did. One employee wanted to put a label bag tag on my plastic bag that had only biscuits, which was personal property just like a purse, which I also had to pay 40€ for, for a rule I doubt that exist and also when it exists that mistreatment can not be justifible. The employee did not also out a label bag tag on my plastic bag with bisuits, I don't know but I think she realized how sarcastic that would look.

Last but not least, I want to say that no one would argue when what happened had a little bit of legitimacy, and also if it was really legitimate and such a rule really exist, maybe try to apply it in a more respectful and humane way, and most importantly more legitimate way. I want a receipt for what I paid for otherwise this looks like mobbing, especially when the employees were stading in the boarding areas like macho gangsters screaming and all. Really I am so angry and I told the employee I will write all about what happened with us today. Words cannot describe how awful I and many other passengers felt. 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻",8,"2023",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Very unresponsive","On 25/07/2023 at 20:05, we tried to cancel our Sabiha Gökçen to Dalaman flight 2 hours and 15 minutes ago through the Pegasus website.

I reported it to another person. The next day, when I called again to confirm, two consultants said they didn't create my record; a new consultant said they did, opened a new record. It's now 10/08/2023 and we still haven't received a response. Despite trying to claim our rights due to an early cancellation, they haven't contacted us in any way.

Plane was clean, seats a little uncomfortable but no real drama.

Both flights delayed but made the time up in the air.

On the way home one case was 4 kilos over, and another 4.5 kilos under. No issues and no problem... did not charge us extra.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Good review for Pegasus","So let me start with I have never wrote a review before but felt it was only fair I did, I’m one for looking for them but never do them.

I read reviews about Pegasus the day before I was flying with them & I was so anxious about my flight with them, I read they had lost bags, the staff was rude the planes wasn’t clean, they had massive delays & also being charged for you’re baggage being over.

I honestly couldn’t tell you how anxious reading this made me, I was absolutely dreading flying with them along with my partner & 4 children, only to get to the airport & check in which took us roughly about 15 minutes, we did have a 20 minute delay but that was nothing to worry about.

The plane was clean & tidy including the toilet the seats was comfortable to sit in, the drinks food ect was what you would expect good selection, although I never eat the hot food on any plane so I can’t comment on that.

The staff was pleasant & helpful too, polite kept everyone update & informed with information needed.

I honestly cannot fault them, we travelled there & back with Pegasus and had a good experience. I hope this puts other people’s minds at ease & maybe encourages others to leave a good review too!",8,"2023",5

"Pegasus-Airlines","Flight Change not working and they charged 5 times","Dear Pegasus Customer Service

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to express my deep disappointment and frustration with the experience I had while trying to change my flight time with your airline.

Recently, I needed to modify my flight schedule, and I decided to use your airline's website to make the necessary changes. However, I was taken aback to discover that there was an extra charge of 100 TL each time I attempted to change my flight time. It was never made clear to me that there would be such a significant fee for this seemingly routine procedure.

Despite the unexpected cost, I proceeded with the changes, attempting to complete the process on five separate occasions. Regrettably, I encountered an error message each time I tried to finalize the transaction. To my dismay, I later discovered that my bank account had been charged five times for the same flight modification, even though the changes were never successfully processed.

This unfortunate situation has caused a considerable inconvenience to me, not only due to the excessive charges but also the multiple failed attempts that resulted in erroneous transactions. I expected a much smoother and more customer-centric process from an airline of your reputation.

In light of this troubling experience, I kindly request the following:

Refund of the excess charges totaling 500 TL that were mistakenly debited from my bank account.
Investigation into the technical issues that caused the errors during my attempts to change the flight time, in order to prevent such incidents in the future.
Assurance that my refund will be processed promptly and with utmost care.
I sincerely hope that you will take my concerns seriously and address them with the urgency they deserve. As a loyal customer, I believe that open and transparent communication is crucial in maintaining a positive relationship between your airline and its patrons.

I am confident that your esteemed airline will take appropriate action to rectify this situation and restore my faith in your services. I look forward to receiving your prompt response and resolution to this matter.

Thank you for your attention to this issue.

Sincerely,

Firat Veral",8,"2023",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","The Pride of Turks: Pegasus Airlines","Well, well, well, where do I even begin with my oh-so-memorable encounter with the ""spectacular"" Pegasus Airlines? Brace yourselves for a rollercoaster of emotions, because this review is about to take you on a journey through the highs and lows of air travel.

First of all, let's talk about the flight cancellations. Because who doesn't love a good surprise, right? Picture this: you've been eagerly awaiting your flight, only to receive the delightful news that your plans have been canceled. But wait, there's more! Pegasus Airlines has a special offer just for you: a replacement flight a whole day later. Who needs punctuality anyway? It's not like time is valuable or anything.

Now, let's talk about the seats. If you're into the whole ""personal space"" thing, Pegasus Airlines is here to crush that dream for you. Say goodbye to legroom, because these seats are designed to make you feel like you're in a sardine can. It's like they took inspiration from contortionists and thought, ""Why not cram people in like Tetris pieces?""

But oh, the real treasure lies in the staff. The ""helpful"" and ""polite"" crew members treat you like a long-lost relative they never wanted to see. It's heartwarming how they channel their inner thieves at Sabiha Airport. Who knew charging you for every possible thing could be such an art form? Maybe they offer a Masterclass on the side.

And speaking of the airport, let's discuss the ambiance. Sabiha Airport, ladies and gentlemen, is the epitome of elegance. It's as if they've taken dirt and crowding to new heights, creating a masterpiece of discomfort. Truly, the airport experience is a chaotic ballet that's bound to leave you questioning your life choices.

But fear not, because the ""sanitary"" conditions of the airplanes will make you forget all about the outside world. Prepare to be immersed in a world of questionable cleanliness and ambiance reminiscent of a thrift store's back alley.

Now, here comes the grand finale: my wholehearted recommendation to absolutely no one. If you're into surprise cancellations, seats that double as medieval torture devices, a staff that could moonlight as con artists, airports that make you rethink your existence, and airplanes that redefine the word ""clean,"" then by all means, book that ticket. Otherwise, I suggest you run in the opposite direction as fast as you can.

In conclusion, my encounter with Pegasus Airlines was like a never-ending dream, in which I kept hoping to wake up. So, do yourself a favor and save your sanity, your wallet, and your precious time. Your future self will thank you for choosing literally any other option for air travel.",8,"2023",1

We have accumulated some BolBol points, but when I tried to use them to cover part of the ticket price they were just written off my program and I was charged the full price.
I have written to Pegasus and called it hotline, asking them to either credit me for the amount of BolBol points I was vainly trying to use or at least restore them to my account.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst flight of my life","We were on the PC 1073 on the 30th of July from Istanbul to Copenhagen. Before take off there was an issue with the aircondition of the airplane, which resulted in a 3 hours delay, but worse than that, we were left in an airplane for 1,5 hour without any new air entering the airplane. We were gradually feeling worse and worse due to a low level of oxygen and a high level of CO2 in the airplane. We requested multiple times for the flight attendants to open the doors as we didn't feel well at all, getting dizzy and having difficulties to breathe. Two people needed medical attention, when the flight attendants finally agreed to open the doors. We were sent back to the gate with no information nor refreshments after a serious dehydration and delay. When we were sent back to the airplane, the payment terminal didn't work, so it was not even an option to buy food or drinks (which were at least supposed to be for free!!!).

We had to stay 24 hour more than what we planned and literally fight to get a hotel. The staff treated us terribly and we wasted one whole day, and I'm not even sure if we could get our money back. It was a traumatic experience for me and I never even think about getting a ticket from this airline ever again.",8,"2023",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Very slow check in procedures! You are very likely miss your Pegasus flight","Travelers beware!!! Pegasus is a low cost airline. So it REALLY tries to make extra money from luggages that are heavier. As the luggages are weighed and scrutinized, the check in times get longer and longer. You are very likely to miss your flight if you fly Pegasus. It takes much longer to check in. Once you are even 5 minutes late to your required check in times they will not board you. They simply do not care to cause the delay, and they treat their customers as adversaries. I had to buy $5990 one way KLM tickets from Istanbul to San Francisco because Pegasus did not board my family on the previous connecting flight from Istanbul to Amsterdam and my family missed the flight. I would avoid flying Pegasus, and if you absolutely have to, then show up 1-2 hours earlier than you would for a regular airline. Advice for Pegasus management: Charge $20 more per flight and avoid long waits at checkin counters. Do a better job at managing this airline! Minor setback is if you do not have a Turkish credit card you won’t be able to buy food or drinks in the plane. They serve nothing for free and their credit card machines do not work with US based credit cards. Get ready to be thirsty! I’m",8,"2023",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Pegasus airlines","Pegasus, resold my flight ticket to other travellers and very easily they can tell that it is allowed by law. I personally think it is just not possible even though it is legal I had expected more honesty and responsibility from Pegasus for me this was the last time flying with Pegasus and I certainly do not recommend it before you know it you are sitting there abroad after a tiring holiday thinking I'm going back home with my family and you are disappointed yes sir unfortunately you have to take the next flight because we have resold the ticket you paid for so there are no more available seats how crazy does that sound? So therefore definitely not recommended that Pegasus.",7,"2023",1

Had a connecting flight, got stuck in Istanbul airport waiting to get through customs so I missed my second flight They claim it's not their fault and it's my problem. They know I'm stuck in a new country with very few options which is a worrying position to be in. They then made me pay £600 extra for a new flight which was 30hrs later, did not help me in the slightest with any assistance for a hotel or somewhere to stay. For no fault of my own I was stuck in Istanbul airport waiting for 30hrs. They're a horrible airline. I wouldn't ever recommend anyone to use them. I would go as far as to say you should adjust your travel plans to avoid them. The worst travel experience of my life.",7,"2023",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Theft from luggage","Pegasus is a budget airline - its main objective is to transport people at the lowest cost possible. They do so by removing unnecessary services, such as onboard meals and so on. No one expects luxary treatment when flying with Pegasus...

With that said, last time I flew with Pegasus my experience was beyond awful.
During check-in, I asked an airline representative to check my carry-on bag and put it in the luggage compartment instead of the cabin. Usually airlines don't charge you for this. Sometimes they even ask you to do it when the flight is full. Pegasus told me this wasn't allowed, but I could pay 50USD for extra baggage allowance and in that case they would be able to check my carry-on. I agreed.

Upon arrival to my final destination, I discovered that a few items were stolen. The total amount of damage was insignificant. However, these items were intended as a gift and therfore were valuable to me.

I reported this incident to the airline, but they refused to compensate the damage, saying ""Pegasus's liability is limited"" and ""Pegasus accepts no responsibility for any liability over the applicable liability limits in accordance with legal regulations.""

I am very disappointed and advise everyone against flying with Pegasus. Especially, through smaller airports like Antalya.",7,"2023",1

But the gate management was so poor, rude and lack the basics of customer service.
And on the flight there was nothing mentionable regarding good service. Aside from the main flight attendant.
One of the flight attendants was just utterly rude and lacks manners.
As I got in the toilet to urinate less then 30 seconds later she comes and bangs on the door and would not stop, I came out frustrated telling her “what!?” She was like “the cockpit needs to use the toilet” I replied “well they can wait just like anybody else, I was waiting for good few minutes before I got in.” Later on I purchase a can of soda and ask for some ice, she goes on and hands me cup of two (1cmx1cmx1cm) ice cubes, I ask for more, then she takes my cup and ads one more cube.

I came 40min before the local flight from Antakya to Istanbul and they did not let me and my husband to register out luggage even though we already checked ourselves online. We insisted in seeing a manager but no one cares about helping us. When we went to buy another ticket, we realized that they play a game with all Travellers. They put people who want to buy tickets ( including those arriving within less than an hour to the registration desk) on their list so that if people come within an hour to their pygasus flight, they give you their place and they have to do the same thing you went through. There is no mercy. We did not find any flight to istanbul to join. Our other flight to Casablanca and we had to buy anther airplane ticket to Casablanca at the vast of 1400$ ( no refund).

Luggage is Confiscated suddenly right at the door of the plane “you are not allowed , just 1 bag “, nobody said that in the entire airport , not at check in , not anywhere , and i never heard of such a thing ever , rest of passengers where allowed however 🤨 .
No explanation whatsoever on why was this necessary , and the staff replies with we don’t know anything about that.
The black guy confiscating the Luggage is rude , incredibly Loud and agressive talking to you like you are a dog or someone that did something really bad, it feels like you’re arrested and questioned ( get another the job ) you are terrible at this .
There is no reason ever to treat anyone like that especially customers.
Get ready for the most uncomfortable seating in low cost airlines , at the end you will feel ran over by a train literally.

After the flight, I noticed that too much money was got from my bank account. Actually, I paid more than 700 euro.
I opened an issue in a service desk to clarify the payments. The service desk provided me with the calculation manual. According to this guideline, I paid more than 400 euro I had to!

Pegasus cancelled two of my flights (outbound and inbound) without me being properly notified. The second cancellation (which involved 2 legs) and subsequent rebooking with Pegasus saw my journey delayed by almost 22 hours when compared to the original time. I received no offers of refreshments, accommodation, or compensation from the airline. Pegasus claim the mobile number they held on me was faulty although upon checking with their contact centre, they appear to hold the correct telephone number.",6,"2023",1

"Pegasus-Airlines","First and last time I will use this airline","I have never had an airline charge for the first checked bag ever so I was not prepared for the $150 usd in fees for my bags. Every drink from water to coffee has a cost food and snacks as well. The size of the aircraft seats was ok typical for any airline but I would say their budget flights are only for people with a carry on who bring their own food and drink. In the end I spent more for this budget airline than I did for a regular one",5,"2023",1

- The flight experience was rough, and makes RyanAir look good.
- Rude staff, who roll their eyes, push past you and ignore you.

I understand its a cheap airline, so pay nothing, except nothing, receive nothing. But it wasn’t even worth the little money i paid for the flight.

Flights were a little uncomfortable but you get what you pay for and it's not as bad as some of the reviews I have read, maybe we were just lucky to have a great flight and holiday, so I would like to thank all staff and pilot 😊 for a fantastic service, would consider booking again in the future 🙌🙏✈️",5,"2023",5

I booked this online from Australia and was concerned that I had never heard of this airline and it had lots of negative reviews. However, it was really the only way to get easily between these two cities and was scheduled at a perfect time, and at a good price - so I booked. When we travelled it was a very pleasant surprise.

The way she asked me to move was absolutely like I was scum I was so shocked I said nothing. I am also a worker myself and I have never talked to anyone like that. I later asked her colleague her name to report her which I will do and the colleague was reluctant to give her name as he saw the transaction
I think this type of behaviour cannot be a one off
She is a shame for the airlines. Low cost means you are subject to crass behaviour??

"Pegasus-Airlines","Negative stars if I could","DO NOT BOOK WITH THESE SCUM BAGS. We have 10 flights with Pegasus as we are doing a big trip. We booked all of our flights in advance and are now realizing a checked bag costs $60 per flight. Some of our flights cost $40 and the checked bag is still $60…. This makes no sense and it’s clear this company is taking advantage of people. We booked through Hopper which lists their misleading flight prices and gives no information about baggage. They told us to contact the airline directly which we have. Haven’t heard back and our flights are coming up in a couple weeks. There are similar flights with Turkish Airlines with bags included but at this point I’m reading online that people didn’t get their refunds. Save your time and money by paying the extra for Turkish airlines. Hope these losers go bankrupt and I’ll do what I can to make this happen. Good luck to everyone else who got screwed by Pegasus, scum of the earth airlines!",5,"2023",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","DO NOT FLY WITH PEGASUS","I booked pegasus as it was the most convenient coming from Barcelona to Dubai. I had 2 connecting flights Barcelona to Istanbul and Istanbul to Dubai, All was fine until we were delayed while on board the aircraft for over 2 hours which resulted to me losing my connecting flight and while one would expect that a person from the airline would apologise and provide the solution I was told that it was my fault as I had not disembarked the aircraft first and did not take the first bus and on top of that the next flight would be the next evening. So instead of either having the crew of the first flight announce that all passengers with connecting flight to Dubai are to be given priority to disembark, or to check the manifests of the flights and see that there is one person that has not disembarked yet, I was supposed to jump over all passengers who have gotten up before the plane even stopped fully and then get on a bus and have the driver take only me so that I can catch the flight. To top it off when I emailed for reimbursement the guest service person told me that since I was not at the gate they will not reimburse me so basically again it was my fault their flight was delayed fro 2 hours.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Do not use Pegasus Airlines","Do not use Pegasus Airlines - avoid at all costs. We flu from Manchester airport on the 24th April it was all going well until we went to the gate to board our flight to be told it was delayed. We let that go as these things happen but once we got onto the plane it got worse the seats looked old and worn, the leg room was terrible and it was so hot on the plane travelling to and from.

Anyway it got even worse leaving antalya airport yesterday, they was late opening check in and when i asked what time it was due to open the man said 2:30 which i was very confused as we was flying at 9:20 and it was currently 6:30am so there wasn't no 2:30 in between. Anyway it opened at 7am and we checked it.

We got to our gate when it opened and we were due to fly at 9:20 so we were waiting in the que to board the plan. Time kept passing and was getting later and later. It got to 9:50am and i overhead a gentleman ask why there was a delay and the response was there isn't no delay!!! Well that was a lie.

We finally got on the plane at 10:00am and was told we wouldn't be flying until 10:40am do at this point we were delayed by 1hour / 20 minutes.

At this point the whole plane were tired and stressed.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Pegasus airline - What a bunch of sneaky robbers","Looks like I'm another mug who has booked with Pegasus. Booking all went well, but later I had to change my flight dates out and back by one day. Made the change on line, all seemed to go well. The new flights were cheaper but I didn't expect a refund. I upgraded to the comfort flex ticket. I was surprised that I had to make the outgoing and return flights seperately, but all seemed OK at the time. I was pleasantly surprised to see that at the end of each invoice there was a £13 credit, I presume this is for the meal I didn't require as a sandwich is included in the Comfort flex ticket. So clicked the button, happy days or so I thought. A few days later on checking my credit card, Pegasus had taken two payments of £190 and £160 pounds. On contacting Pegasus's excuse for customer relations, I have just been told that I made two changes and fees apply, full stop! I can't find anywhere on the Pegasus airlines what fees are due, just that fees wil be charged. What's worse, is I haven't travelled yet and as I am a frequent business flyer to Turkey, before this highway robbery I booke a seperate trip, so I have two to look forward to and judging by other reviews on this site, it's not going to be a pleasure.....At least Dick Turpin had the decency to wear a mask. If Pegasus do the decent thing and reduce the fees to a reasonable rate, I will happily update this review. Watch this space!",5,"2023",1

In the end I arrived at the gate 15 minutes early and there was no staff anymore so I could not board the plane, same thing happened to 2 other people with different destinations, we were in the line together. I went to 4 Pegasus information/help centers in the airport, every single one was not willing to pay my next flight and blamed me for not arriving even earlier. The announcement when they say last call started a few minutes after I was at the gate but there was still no one. I ended up with the supervisor and they were rude very direct not even willing to hear properly. NEVER AGAIN! I will make sure to write reviews everywhere.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst airline in the world... Stay away from Pegasus Airlines","I travel from Istanbul to London on regular basis with my partner and 4 year old daughter. We had small issues with Pegasus but our last flight is not acceptable in any way. The staff at the check-in counters are plain racist. They over charge you depending on your race. I have witnessed them asking Turkish and other foreign nationals to empty their suitcases or pay unreasonable prices but UK nationals just drop off their bags and go without getting their suitcases checked thoroughly like other nationals.
When we travelled from Istanbul to London we had 1 handbag, 1 laptop bag (we called up the customer services and confirmed that we can take them on board as they are personal items) and 2 carry-on bags and we were told we were allowed to take these on our flight. On the way back, I bought 20 kg luggage on my return as we did some shopping but it was no way over 20 kg. When we went to the airport they said we were 27 kilos and charged us 70 GBP. They work so slow to make sure people are late for their flights so they cannot argue with them about the price. My 4 year old was on her feet for hours and she just wanted to get on the plane to sit so I just paid the amount knowing they were thieves.

It gets worse, when we were about the board the plane. They said we could not take our carry-on bag to the plane as we had 1 handbag and 1 laptop bag with us like our fliht from Istanbul and claimed we were only allowed 1 bag each. When we tried to explain to them that we came from Istanbul with these bags and confirmed with them or that we can put the laptop bag in the carry-on as it had my daughter’s snacks and toys in it, they just got rude and said we won’t be able to board if we do not pay up the 63 GBP. They made my daughter cry in hysterics by saying we could not board the plane if we do not pay. What kind of a person would harass a 4 year old?

In order to calm my daughter down we paid the amount thinking we would take it on board but at the gate of the plane, they took the carry-on bag from us. It had my 4-year olds snacks and toys in it but these monsters would not listen. When we boarded the plane, we saw a lot of people with large backpacks and carry-on bags and there were enough spaces in the overhead cabins to fit ours and heard a lot of Turkish people complain about the same issue but there is obviously not a single helpful staff in the company to solve the issue.

I told them that I will pay the amount but complain about them to the company and everywhere possible including relevant authorities and social media and they do not act fair and single out people. I have contacted the company (complaint application number 08492999) and they did not even bother to make an effort. All the company and the racist staff try and do is rob the customers by acting unprofessional and treat people wrong with their arrogance and . I will not stop until I get an official apology for their inhumane and racist attitude towards me and my family and get the unduly collected amount refunded.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Pegasus Airlines","I booked a flight with Pegasus from Manchester to Karachi return during Christmas as other options were very expensive. It was honestly a very big mistake for me to go on pegasus. The flight was delayed on twice and both of the times their service was absolutely horrible. The staff is rude, unaccommodating and did not bother to give us a single piece of food/appetizer/water despite delaying the flight. The air hostess was reluctant to give me a full glass of water. For Pegasus it isn't enough to be cheap airline they will do anything and everything to make sure you feel cheap whether that's service, food, or delays you name it. They even broke my bag and I have a picture of them throwing my bag over the car to get it loaded. Absolutely no regards for their passengers.
They landed in Antalya airport and made us wait a few hours without even informing us where we were and why we were waiting.
Honestly I wouldn't even go on another flight on Pegasus even if they paid me. Just thinking of the experience makes me want to puke.",4,"2023",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Biggest Scammers","The worst organization and the worst client service I have ever witnessed in my whole life in terms of air flight company. Not only do they steal money from you whenever they have the opportunity to do it, but also have the most rude customer service employees. They are absolutely not involved in your issue (knowing that it is their job to do so) and are not motivated to help you the slightest. Every time you call them, you have a different version of their policies and what happened during the booking process. Horrible. Do not book with them, it's not worth the discounted prices.",4,"2023",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","USE ANY OTHER AIRLINE!","Guys, be very careful before you book with Pegasus Airlines. Here's my story (so you can avoid being mugged off by them):

* We checked in for a flight on the 29th March to fly from Turkey to Georgia. There were zero issues and their staff didn't notify us that our bags were slightly over the limit.

* Our flight was cancelled.

* After 14 hours of waiting, we checked in for a second time (and their staff mentioned NOTHING about our bags being over the limit).

* Once we were through security, we were pulled aside and asked to pay 200 Lira for our bags being slightly over the weight limit. Naturally, I tried to refuse because we were not told about it. Had their staff told us we could have moved some items from our luggage to our hand luggage and avoided the mess.

* Alas, we were threatened in front of 100 people and told that if we did not pay, our luggage would be lost and we would not be allowed on the flight.

* It then turned out that the 200 Lira was actually 480 Lira (approx £40 pounds).

This is what PegasusAirlines does. They pretend like everything is OK and then they blackmail you into paying them extra.

Can you believe the cheek of it?

Two of their employees checked our luggage in with a smile - and then they had the audacity to inform us AFTER THE FACT that we were slightly over the weight limit.

For all we know, they could have been lying.

Oh, and to add insult to injury, one of our suit cases is now broken - AND they are refusing to refund the money.

DO NOT USE THIS AIRLINE. THEY WILL RIP YOU OFF!",4,"2023",1

Then I get told to pay for a new check in altho I already paid it twice! Now I pay a third check in!!!
In short Ended up buying new ticket + spending close to £900 on baggage. Yea £900 on baggage , I advise you never to take pegasus unless you travelling with a cabin bag and super light. Don't trust the staff also , do your research and take travel Insurance if you do choose them.

Long story short we missed our international connection home and had to purchae new flights, we are progressing a claim with our travel insurance and they have asked for a confirmation from the airlines that they cancelled their flights. Turkish Air have provided this but Pegasus will not, they keep claiming that they can't provide the confirmation as they ""are not allowed to process your inquiry under the scope of the GDPR Data Protection Law"", they claim this as the email address on the booking is our travel agent and not ours.

Staff was really rude and Unprofessional and almost yells on customers on stansted airport.
If anybody want to wear an Eastern or relegious dress then stay away from this airline.",3,"2023",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Customer service","The staff was extremely unprofessional and rude , I wasn’t allowed to board my flight as there was an issue with my visa which was a fault on their side because they weren’t ready to understand or look up my visa details and instead continued to cut me off and yell at me . The staff was also racist towards me as they were uncooperative once they saw my Indian passport . when I tried to reach another staff was help she was just as rude . When we pay for a service , we’re expected to be treated in a certain way and when those expectations aren’t met it’s highly disappointing. I can undoubtedly confirm that I will never be using this airline again and won’t recommend it to anyone either . I’d burn this airline down if I had the chance to .",3,"2023",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst service from air company ever","I used this company flights few times and it was with troubles always.
My flights were delayed from 1 till 3 hours, what were unappreciated especially when I was in transit. Their customer services is always unavailable - you can not call them from any country exclude their native Turkey, but if you are there and trying to call them - they dont answer in 90% cases.
They provide no answer by proposed on site Whatsapp, and by e-mail on noticed time ( its over 48 hours each time).
But when they answer you it is absolutely inapplicable, because they provide you link to website or info from website only and never answer to your solid question.
Usage of their services it just waste of money, time and your mental health.
And when you onboard finally you should pay for all - including glass of water.
I have extremaly worst experience with this aircompany!",3,"2023",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Expensive and bad service","Very expensive flight for economy ticket, small and uncomfortable with no food or drinks included, you won't get even water. At the gates counter I tried to ask the exact time of the gate open, because clearly the time was long passed and the pegasus people at the counter didn't even look at me and completely ignored me. In the plane the crew was not friendly, feels like I owe them something. Flight was delayed, no further information was given if the connection flight is even possible or what to do. You are left on your own. Strangely enough, the workers at the Turkish airport had the exact same bad attitude towards you as from pegasus.
This was the first and last time I fly with them or any other Turkish fly airlines. Avoid, avoid at all costs.",3,"2023",1

But then when I proceeded with the refun they refunded amount minus 150 usd, the total amount was paid 1200usd plus conversion fee. But 150 dollars for service fees it's a lot!!! However, when you buy the tickets, it's said that with Comfort Flex you will get total refund without penalty.",3,"2023",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Great Airline surprised our expectations!","My partner and I flew from London Stanstead to Dubai via a stop in Istanbul. From check in to arrival both ways everything ran smoothly.

"Pegasus-Airlines","PEGASUS IS THE WORST AIRLINE
DON'T EVER USE IT","Nobody should use this airline. Their first flight was delayed and due to it passengers arrived late, but there was still time before the next flight as it was also delayed but they didnt allow passengers to fly. They didnt offer any hotel or alternative flight nd asked the passengers to buy new tickets. Then they lost one of their luggages. The representatives were very rude and didn't help with anything.

"Pegasus-Airlines","The worst airlines ever!","I had a connecting flight from Bergamo to Doha with a scale in istanbul. I bought the ticket less than one day before the flight. As soon as I arrived to Bergamo at the check in desk the employees of pegasus airlines announced that my flight was canceled and they sent an email, but I didn’t receive it anywhere!!

I had just 2 options, to stay 2 days more in the hotel provided by them to take the next flight which was not sure would be done or not or to take my refund and do whatever I wanted.

So, having the flight for an urgency at my workplace I just left the airport and took another flight, being ensured by the employee that the refund would be done without any problem.

BUT! It’s already more than one month that I ask for my refund and they just don’t want to do it!

I got SMS message from them that I can cancel my tickets with a full refund, the same fact was confirmed in the customer support over the phone. I spent 600EUR to buy alternative tickets as I had some arrangements. In the end Pegasus didn't give my any money since I bought tickets via SmartFare they are refusing to help.

They just lied to me (that the tickets are refundable) and refused to give what was promised. JUST AVOID USING THESE GUYS IN ANY POTENTIAL SITUATION (OTHERWISE, YOU ARE AT RISK THAT YOUR MONEY ARE JUST STOLEN)",3,"2023",1

"Pegasus-Airlines","The worst company is PEGASUS !!!","Incredibly bad company! We traveled from Oslo via Istanbul to Dubai with children. Our daughter has cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair. On all companies, people with disabilities get on the plane first. In this company, we boarded last with our daughter! We even had to hold her in our arms and wait until all the passengers settled down so that we could set down, unforgivable and a terrible shame for this company! When we landed in Istanbul at Sabiha airport, we only had 40 minutes until the next flight. The people working on transferring disabled people did not help us and let us walk through the entire airport on our own without any help. At the security check, we had to wait in a long line to get in line for examination (I note that it is a child who is disabled), no one even offered to let us in front. When we managed to get to our turn, the woman who was inspecting us and our belongings took food from my daughter and wanted to throw it in the trash (my daughter has a PEG implanted in her stomach and feeds on tube food, special food in plastic bottles ). I managed to stop her, but everyone from the security control started screaming at me in Turkish, which of course I don't understand. None of them speak English (shame)! Finally, we managed to break up with the argument and they left the food, but then they started to provoke us in the way ""you need a pap from the doctor"" to which I lifted my shirt and showed them the mark on my daughter's stomach. Shame! When we arrived on the flight that was going from Istanbul to Dubai, they attacked us because we were arguing at the security check, and of course, in terrible English, they didn't even bother to understand where the problem was. Of course we got on the plane again last! Both planes were terribly old, the seats were terribly dirty, the toilet...everything was in bad condition! I do not recommend this company at all. I have never seen the most disgusting staff in my life. I have heard many passengers that they complain . When we landed in Dubai, of course, like everything else, the stroller was not waiting for us! Which is unacceptable. Our trip to Dubai remained a bad memory only because of the PEGASUS company! Never again !
On the way back, they damaged my suitcase, I reported it in Oslo at the counter, but when I tried to report it on the Pegasus website, it was not possible. There is no contact email address to which you can apply. There is only a form to fill in the data and when I did that and tried to add the documents, of course it didn't work. The only thing written on the page is as in the picture.",3,"2023",1

Seats are very uncomfortable. They don't recline and the leg space is very very little.
We had to buy food and drinks, nothing is offered by the airline although our flight was quite long.
Transit at Sabiha Gokcen Airport was a tragedy on its own right with very limited seating areas and passengers sleeping on the floor, let alone extremely rude and impolite staff.
Definitely would not recommend it to anybody with long flights or transit time especially if they have children or elderly family members.",3,"2023",1

The stuff at the desk, specially superviser- absolutely useless, rude and unprofessional. He could only show off infront of other people to show his power, acting like a superstar with superpower. The worst experience in my life. It is really better to pay more, but save your nerves and time. Probably they act this way because they know that will not get any punishment for their behaviour. Even when I asked other stuff they said, you can do this and that, but most likely nothing changes. That's really pity, because even if it is lowcoster- they should be good enough and respect passengers. I know many lowcosters which do great job. Pegasus- just disappointing airline.",3,"2023",1

"Pegasus-Airlines","Declined boarding at the airport.","This is the first time I have write a review for Pegasus. Though technically speaking they are how other airlines are apart from the very cheap prices, but since this itself cannot be the reason for good or bad review. My review about the airlines is based on an experience that has struck me very hard.
I visited Saudi Arabia for my father's open heart surgery in December 2022 and obtained a visa on arrival that is visa at Riyadh airport, KSA. I had flown with Turkish Airlines.
This visa is valid for one year and allows multiple entries into Saudi Arabia.

This time I flew again in February 2022 to support my father with the recovery phase with Pegasus Airlines via Turkey to Riyadh.
The airline employee asked me to wait for a long time and then denied me entry to the plane because of my nationality (probably) and lack of knowledge of Saudi Arabian regulations. I showed proof of my previous visit along with the official regulation on the Saudi Arabia website and my entry and return stamps from that visit.
The airport worker was unwilling to inform me of my right as a passenger and explain my situation. They were rude and unhelpful, I was not allowed to board the plane. After begging at the last moment to at least show proof of refusal. The official only allowed me to take a photo of the visa request from Pegasus, which could also be fake.

This behavior cost me not only financial, emotional and physical damage, but also humiliation.

I tried to make my complaint by phone, but no one in Turkey, Germany and the Netherlands answered. Then I also complained online on the website and I still haven't received an answer since around 3 weeks.
I cannot tolerate such behavior when the person in charge does not know the rules and is also selfish when it comes to passengers being passed the information to raise awareness. The actual proof that I am allowed to board the flight is in my passport along with my boarding pass from December.

Based on my this experience and an awareness for the future flyers I write this review.",3,"2023",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Stay Far Away from Pegasus Airlines! Very Bad Service!!","NEVER AGAIN fly with Pegasus airlines! It's the WORST!!

BELIEVE THE LOW RATED REVIEWS!

The flight I was on arrived late before the connecting departure flight! IT DOESNT MAKE SENSE! It feels like this is done to multiple people intentionally on purpose to get you to stay in a hotel for a night until the next day for your travel after speaking with passengers who were also upset.

Pegasus Airlines does NOT accept any responsibility for when they commit a mistake which ruins your travel plans by helping you transfer a different destination flight to get you to where you need to be. The Pegasus receptionists at the counter desks are useless!

Pegasus Airlines does NOT reimburse you back with money YOU have to withdraw out of YOUR bank account to purchase a visa to enter into Turkey in order to stay at their accommodated hotels.

Everything done running and speeding to not miss the flight and only made it by few minutes!!. My return from Istanbul to London was cancelled the same morning I had to fly back. Literally a few hours prior, on my way to the airport. Wasted so much money to come back from airport pay for another night at the hotel not finding any alternative flights back on the same day and losing a day of work. I had no help from the airlines support at all. All I found was a bunch of rude people on the line who were not willing to help at all. I did not get a refund of my tickets since they were the once to cancel the flights, I did not get alternative flight and I had to pay again almost £1000 to fly back to London the next day. Nobody tried to help in any way. I called customer service uncountable times and nobody knew what to do. I asked for at least the refund but was literally shouted at over the phone. I was stuck in Istanbul and I had work the next day.

Temperature inside the cabin kept very hot and no drinking water allowed unless you bought it . Despite repeated requests to bring the temperature down on the thermostat, no action taken.
A number of passengers were feeling overheated and were trying to fan themselves with makeshift fans . Heat was enough to make you unwell !!
And absolutely no drinks given. On request for water, I was told only water to take medication allowed. So you had to get sick and dehydrated with the heat before they would give you any drinking water to take medication.

After this incident when we went to Pegasus counter they treated all the people like dogs and can't able to give any solution, they told us if you have visa we can provide you hotel accommodation but if you don't have visa for turkey then we can do anything you have to take the next flight which is on next day at same time 20:55, we are transit passengers and lots of people were not have visa for turkey including us, but when we asked for solution that what we can do then they don't have any answers and acting weird and avoiding you and telling you to move from the pegasus help desk.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Bad service","I do not know how they can reject my complaint directly, although I only objected to the delay for two days, during which I remained without work and paid for them, and I did not ask you to refund the ticket in full.

I understand that the first plane could not land due to weather conditions, but my complaint is about the second plane from Istanbul to Lyon. My plane was 5 hours after the first plane, and although it took off two or three hours late, you did not move anyone. We waited for 8 hours without you getting up. By any measure, we could have caught up with our second plane during these hours. I apologize, but the reason here is not the weather, but rather your negligence and indifference to people's work and times, although if we had been transported in buses, we would have arrived at Sabiha airport before the second plane took off.

The problem did not end here, after the waiting queues that we stood for hours in order to board and return to Sabiha airport, we were surprised when we arrived that the flight had left us, and we had to stand in a second queue standing on foot, jostling, disorganization and recklessness of employees who leave their positions from 3 pm until At 9:30 at night, just to get a new flight ticket.
Upon reaching the employee, after all these hours of waiting, I thought that the company would do miracles not to delay us for our lives, I was surprised that I could not go on the next flight the next day nor the one after that until the day of the 5th, I had to choose the nearest flight to France because The company I work for called me and informed me that I must return and that the days that I do not work will be deducted from my salary, and if they exceed 3 days, it will be considered an unjustified absence, because they do not believe that there is an airline like yours that takes three days to solve a passenger’s problem on its lines and takes weather conditions as an excuse.

The employee suggested to me a trip to Marseille on January 4 instead of January 5, although I live near Lyon, but I had to return quickly, so as not to lose my job, and my wife also so as not to lose her job, which also lost two days of her salary, and my child, who had to Return to school as it is considered absent without justification.

I contacted my daughter’s school and they asked me for a letter of justification from the airline. Here I had to contact you in order to request this letter. After waiting and trying several times, the employee was unable to provide me with the message due to a defect in the system. She asked me to call later. I called later and also waited until she told me that it was The message was sent to me via e-mail, but I was surprised that I did not receive any message and that the employee only registered the complaint, after I spent 70 euros as a communication cost in order to obtain this letter. Isn't this your negligence and negligence?

Since I was booked into Marseille, which is 3 and a half hours away by car, and since I will have 7 bags (they were 6 bags, but with a difference of half a kilo to one kilo between one and the other, the Picassos employee in Erbil forced me to buy a seventh bag weighing 5 kilos at a cost of 100 euros to cover Total excess weight!!??In such matters, you are very accurate, but if the opposite happens, the complaint is rejected) I asked my friend to come in my car because it was difficult to return via several transportations with seven bags.

We arrived in Marseille, we waited for an hour to receive our bags, but there was nothing. We went to the baggage department to inquire about the reason for not having our bags. We were surprised that our bags had been sent to Lyon!!!!! Although I assured the employee to transfer my bags, and I also inquired with more than one employee, they all told me that my bags had been transferred and I would receive them in Marseille!!
I had to go from Marseille airport to Lyon airport to collect my bags and come back at night.",1,"2023",1

We returned to the plane and the only thing they agreed to give us without paying .

Then I got on my flight and was told that the connection will be sorted for me, upon arrival at Istanbul I was given false directions and made to run around the airport like a donkey. Then I was told that there wouldn’t be a connection till the next day and that they will put me in a hotel, so I asked for my bag as I’d prefer to have it and then made to wait hours for it and again given false directions and walking around the airport like an idiot with every staff member pointing me towards another and the other sending me back.

Never again my children travelled this month we own the mistake off them having a small rucksack and there small suitcase each should have been just 1.
Crew stand there shouting you have 4 mins 3 min while CHILDREN try and decant there belongings no help just shouted at they are in tears and crew member on their phone. Children hysterically crying us as parents helpless as not travelling with them.
Suitcase are broken and CHILDREN have to try and get them on the plane while be counted down.
Then the out of date food my daughter ate, she then threw up A CHILD was left to GET ON WITH it.

"Pegasus-Airlines","NEVER EVER FLY WITH PEGASUS AIRLINES","I must say this is the worst airline have ever flown with, I fluw from Baghdad to Oslo. in Turkey they had a foggy weather so we had to redirect our flight to Istanbul instead of Sabiha gokcen, when we landed in Istanbul airport would they not let us leave the plane until they got clearense from the company that we can leave. It took us 4 HOURS BEFORE WE COULD LEAVE THE PLANE WITHOUT ANY WATER AND NO FOOD!!!! and also not to forget how the air was inside the cabin, it was so hot that people couldn't breathe, after we left the plane we sat inside a terminal for 5 more hours before we got a flight back to Sabiha gokcen, when we finally landed in Sabiha we ran to our connecting flight because it said we had 30 min before departure, when we arrived at the gate it got delayed 1 houre more eventually it kept getting delayed for 9 HOURS at the end passengers including me got mad at staff that they finally made us board the plane after 9 hours. so I am telling you guys NEVER EVER FLY WITH PEGASUS AIRLINES,",1,"2023",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Got exactly what I booked","I booked and flew CGN-SAW-DXB and back with them and had a pleasant experience. Everything went fine and I got exactly what I booked.
Connections didn't cause any problems, even if the DXB-SAW flight on the return had an hour delay, which made the time to transfer a little short. No problem, as the staff at the boarding gate knew about the delay and waited for me and another passenger that had the same problem. So i arrived on time both ways.
I also pre-ordered food which was tasty and came as described upon ordering.
I'd fly with Pegasus again at any time.",1,"2023",4

Cons - I had booked the flight from Munich to Dammam via Istanbul and had paid for the check in Baggage while booking the ticket online. I was told that the check in bag would be booked till Dammam. But strangely at the Istanbul Airport, I was asked to take the checked in bag as hand bag for which I had to pay extra for the Evisa to get inside Turkey to take the checked in bag. Despite several inquiries with the Airline staff, no real reason or explanation given for this inconvenience.",1,"2023",3

The staff were extremely rude I was set next to a deaf gentleman and they completely ignored him and looked at him funny when he tried to explain things to him. Luckily I do British sign so was able to assist the guy. He had an injured leg and they did not help him at all. I went to speak to flight attendant called, sim or so she says it was as she knew I would complain, she asked me if I was crazy and was extremely rude with her body gesture. I asked to speak to the manager who was also rude and ignored my complaints about the way they had treated the man with hearing impairments. I have complained to which they answered the deaf man had thanked them on leaving the plane- wow what a really poor service from start to finish. Never will I ever use this service again.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Low Cost Airline with good service","I took a flight from Casablanca to Moscow with stopover in Istanbul. After reading reviews I was very afraid. I had only 2 hs. to so security control in Istanbul and I was afraid to losing it because of delays. My big luggage was 20,1 kg and I was afraid they will ask me to pay more weight because I bough 20 kg. My hand luggage was heavy and slightly bigger than the company TyC. Also my luggage was checked in Casablanca and I was afraid they would loose it or no having enough time to put it in the second place... Pegasus didn't have office at the airport and only has 1 flight through Casablanca, so until 3 hs. before my flight nobody shows... But... I was first in the lkne when check in started. All was very fast and easy. They didn't charged extra weight, they didn't checked hand luggage size or weight (I have seen passengers with many bags and they allowed them to go), both flights were in time, staff and crew kind and helpfull... So... I will flight again with Pegasus",12,"2022",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Flex option is a rip off","I purchased the Flex option for my flight. When the time came to change my flying date I went online to make the changes. By that time the new flight was cheaper than what I had originally paid. When I made the change I was charged an administration fee of €50. I subsequently called the airline which told me that the FLEX option does not mean that changes are ""free of charge"" - IT SIMPLY MEANS THAT THE ADMIN FEE WILL BE A MAXIMUM OF €50.

This is not what the airline is advertising - the FLEX option is advertises ""free changes and cancellation"".",12,"2022",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Terrible customer service and glitches app","I flew with Pegasus Airlines in December on a flight back to London from Dubai. I booked an extra leg room seat on the flight through the app. It took my money but didn't provide me with confirmation that my seat was booked. When I told them at the check-in desk he shrugged me off and said there is nothing he can do, try asking them in Turkey at the transit desk.

The flight leaving Dubai was delayed becauae they said they had to clean the plane so boarding was 1 hour late. This meant that we missed our connecting flight anyway. Then at the transit desk in Turkey they could not give me an extra leg room seat or alternative because they were taken. They passed the buck again and told me to email Pegasus for refund.

It was a total disaster.

When we got home I emailed Pegasus with the proof of the payment taken and they refunded my friend who travelled with me for her booked seat, but not me. When I asked them where my refund was they said that the ticket is closed.

I will never fly with Pegasus again and do not recommend them. Pay the extra and fly Emirates.",12,"2022",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Perfectly good flights experience","I was apprehensive about flying with Pegasus after reading some of the reviews here, but can only say that if you prepare properly, this is a perfectly good flight experience. Both my flights on this journey were on time. Clean, new planes, friendly staff both on the ground and in the air.
Yes, this is a low cost airline and as such you pay for a bottle of water, or a snack on the plane, or you take it with you. If you can't handle that, then that is not the airline's fault. Yes you pay for bags, so what? If you don't like that pay for bags as part of your initial ticket price with other airlines.
If your schedule is such that Pegasus is a goord option, don't hesitate to take it.",12,"2022",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","THE WORST AIRLINE","We were switched to Pegasus airlines by KLM because our connection was missed. Pegasus is equal to 1970s airline with very few amenities and of course not only did they lose our luggage but they blamed KLM.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Mr.","I am a frequent traveler where I fly minimum 4 times per month. Been flying for the past 25 years but I’ve never ever experienced such a terrible and bad flight experience with the ground staff. I had bought the highest priced ticket in order to have a comfortable seat and have my luggage checked in and carry on. Flying from Budapest was perfect but from Istanbul to Beirut I was treated as if they gave me the ticket as charity and the lady who was handling the boarding at the gate was such an arrogant and aggressive and impolite to the extent that I was going to cancel my trip of it wasn’t Christmas and I had to be with my family tomorrow morning. The ground staff are extremely bad and I will never ever take any Pegasus flight and I will recommend all my friends and affiliates to do the same not to face such a bad experience.",12,"2022",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","NEVER FLY PEGASUS. Counter screams at you. Charges $163 for baggage","Pegasus is TRULY THE WORST AIRLINE EVER.
Story about screaming lady: It took 30 mins to check in because the counter lady wouldn't issue our tickets. She doesn't know that countries have tourist visa waiver and said she couldn't let us onboard without a visa in our passport. Anyways she contacted immigration and they told her we could board. Throughout the process she'll ask us questions about our travel plans very rudely and would shut us up when we are trying to explain about the visa waiver. At the end of it she's basically yelling at us. 
story about the fees: Then she looked at our Carry on bag, tagged it to make sure it was compliant to size requirements. At the boarding gate, the staff said we couldn't board with that bag even though we have the tagged carry on. They charged us €163!!!!! Daylight robbery!! At the bus between terminal and plane, the same lady appeared and basically scolded us for lying to her about our bag. We were carrying it the whole time and did not conceal from her! I pointed out to her that she was the one who tagged the carry on tag. She said, and I quote, ""this is not up for discussion!"" In the angriest tone ever. I wish I recorded all my conversations with her to post on the internet. She is so nasty!!!

After I was in Turkey we checked tickets for Konya and in last minute they cancelled flight when I was at the airport.

Because I bought the Gaziantep to Istanbul flight separately the pegasus staff in Gaziantep did not want to transfer my language to London flight. I had about 1.5 hours connection time and I had to collect my language in Istanbul then go check in again for London. I wasn't feeling well and I was running round like headless chicken. So poor service. The staff doesn't care about the customers. Myself and all my family won't use Pagasus Airlines again for the future.",12,"2022",1

"Pegasus-Airlines","The Worst Flight Experience","I had booked tickets for two connected flights. London-Istanbul (PC1162), Istanbul-Tbilisi (PC314). First flight arrived on time (10:32PM +3) but second flight got delayed indefinitely and then got canceled. We had to wait for 9 straight hours before they gave us a new flight. Considering the fact that the security had some problems with my documents and the security didn't let me stay in hotel, i had to sit on airport chair for 9 hours. The New flight (PC7314) departed at 09:28AM+3 and arrived in Tbilisi at 12:17PM+4. I was completely exhausted and unable to even walk at the end of this endeavor. I specifically booked these two flights because there was small wait time in-between the flights. But it did not turn out well. To sum up all the above mentioned, I believe I am entitled to some kind of compensation for my experience.",12,"2022",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst flight experience ever","This was how it should feel to be in hell for several hours. The space between the legs in my row was not even 20cm. I'm just 1.80m and I couldn't fit in any way possible. I booked the flight as an emergency to get back home and I regret my decision. Hostesses and stewards kicked me every time they passed by since my legs where forced to be put on the corridor. Really, this is worst than a low cost at a full price (difference with Qatar Airways was just 100€).
I will never take this cargo for pigs anymore. They sincerely should issue some kind of apologies.",12,"2022",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","No customer service","This is not a review about a particular flight, rather about the customer service, or ""not existing customer service"".

I have bought two-way tickets for Zurich-Istanbul.

EXTRA PAYMENT FOR FLEXIBLE TICKET
I paid extra for my return ticket to be flexible. But I just saw there is no difference with my flexible or non-flexible tickets. If I want to change the date of the return ticket, it is to be charged.

Now what the firms normally do is, if the ticket price for the new date is higher, they add that to the fee, which is totally fine. In Pegasus case, there is no clarity about it. Will I pay the ticket fee whole again and lose the other ticket completely? Not clear.

CALL - CENTER DISASTER

Well, then, I call the call-center. No answer.

Okay, there is a second number for their members. (By the way, I had to become a member because they didn't let me buy a ticket without creating a membership first.) Then I call the second number with the telephone number that I was registered: ""This number is for our members. Thank you for calling."" And that was it!

So basically, there is no human being whatsoever to answer the phone.

Then I reach with WhatsApp number, which of course is only a senseless robot.

Bottom line:
If you really have to fly with this firm:
• Don't buy anything extra, be very clear about your dates,
• Try to do everything to prevent a situation that you will need someone to call.

Terrible! Terrible!",12,"2022",1

On arrival in Yerevan our luggage was lost. Filed a complaint and they said our luggage was lost but would arrive in Yerevan 5 days later...5 DAYS!!! Without any explaination or saying they were sorry we had to spend the next days buying everything we needed (clothes, shampoo, aftershave, gifts and so on) The hotel helped us out in every possible way and finally we got a message from Pegasus that our luggage was found and would be taken to the hotel on our last day in Yerevan. GREAT!?!
Then our host got a phonecall saying there were issues with the luggage and that we had to go to the airport ourselves to pick it up. After going through extencive security checks and screening we finally got our luggage in the middle of the night.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Flight got cancelled and no help given","My flight got cancelled on Sunday 23rd evening and we was not given a hotel or travel support by the airline. They did book us another flight the following day, but this caused us a major inconvenience as we had to go back home and come back the next morning - total 3hour journey. I was appalled to have been given poor customer service, there was no clear direction or communicate on where we should stay or what the airline will provide us. I was shocked to know that they couldn’t do anything for us. I was with my two kids and wife. This is a shocking airline and would definitely not recommend anyone to travel through them as they are very unreliable. I’m",10,"2022",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Robert Budzynski discriminatory behavior","We arrived at the counter of Pegasus airlines at London Stansted airport. Robert Budzynski, who claimed to be in charge of the airline mentioned that backpacks are not allowed as personal items. My boyfriend was carrying a backpack so we asked if we could store the backpack in our carry on and carry a tote bag as a personal item instead - he mentioned that only females were allowed to carry tote bags, men can only carry smaller bags - so I carried the tote bag and gave my boyfriend my crossbody bag for him to carry it. When we arrived at the gate Robert completely contradicted himself and asked us to put the tote bag away - when he initially told us it would be okay if I was carrying it! He insisted that we could not board the plane even when the airport security guard allowed us to. He reacted very angrily and started screaming at us, saying that he was in charge and we could not board. We mentioned this was a gender issue as females were being allowed with tote bags, and he said he could not discriminate because he was gay. He finally let us through, after we pointed out he was being violent and his and the airlines policy were being discriminatory. Even the airport security admitted that the issue is with the airline, and this is not the first time it has happened. Robert’s unprofessional behavior made flying with Pegasus airlines a horrible experience. Please avoid this airline at all costs.",10,"2022",1

"Pegasus-Airlines","Workers are absolutely the worst I've met","The event that I am about to describe occurred on Oct. 23, 2022 at the DMM Airport (Saudi Arabia) at approximately 01:00.

I approached the check-in counter where the worker, Mohammad, asked me, ""Where do you come from?"" I was bit confused by this question because I didn't understand what exactly he wanted to know. I said, ""I am coming from Dammam...?"" which was the city I was in. He then rudely, and quite arrogantly, replied, ""Don't you have two legs? I said where did you come from? From that line or that line?"" as he gestured at the queues. I told him I came from ""this"" line. First of all, I was appalled by the way he was speaking to me. I can confidently say that out of the 30 years of traveling, I have never experienced customer service as terrible as this.

After explaining that his question in the first place was not clear because I could have answered the question in literally a thousand ways, his neighboring colleague, red-faced, comes over to the counter, rips away my passport and comes a few inches from my face and yells, ""WE WILL NOT BOOK YOUR TICKET! GET OUT OF HERE AND GO TALK WITH SOMEONE ELSE!""

During the chaos, the Session Manager named ABDULLATIF AL QAHTANI comes to ask what is going on. I explain exactly what happened, while the other two workers tell their own version of the story, making false claims that I told them that since I am an American, I deserve to be in the front of the line...

At this point, I am extremely furious so I asked for the check-in workers full names, but the Abdullatif al Qahtani refuses to give me their names. I look at the workers' names but they had either removed their name tags or were actively covering it so I could not see their names. After asking for 5 minutes for their names, Abdullatif al Qahtani came to my face and said exactly this, ""Stop this sh*t and f*ck off before I cancel your ticket. You have 2 minutes to get out of my face. This is Saudi Arabia, not America.""

FURIOUS, I asked him who his superior is, to which Abdullatif replies, ""There is no other superior. I am the king here. Leave now before you disrespect yourself again. I'm giving you two minutes.""

I've never written a review for an airline or for any particular worker ever in my life because it's not worth my time. However, this event was so outrageous that I feel obliged to write a review for the sake of future customers.

*If certain actions are not taken to remove the Session Manager Abdullatif al Qahtani from the Pegasus workforce and the DMM Airport, it is a clear indication that Pegasus Airlines does not care about the well-being of their customers. I understand that one person's reflection of the company may not represent the entire company. However, Abdullatif al Qahtani's demonstration of unprofessionalism does leave a HUGE mark towards this company that should be unacceptable. His anger issues absolutely does not represent this company in any valuable way. Therefore, I urge Pegasus, for the sake of their own dignity and for the future of all customers, to remove ABDULLATIF AL QAHTANI as soon as possible.",10,"2022",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Avoid at all cost","When buying a cheap ticket keep in mind you get what you pay for, or like in Pegasus airlines case even less.
When having terrible experience at Istanbul airport with Pegasus I saw a whole crowd of people at their office window with other issues. Some people missed their flight because they were mislead by the airline company changing their gate , some were turned back at the gate because some person decided so wrongfully. I've never seen such an amount of lack of any care to their customers and absolutely horrible rude customer service and people's days and plans being ruined .
They didn't let me board because I didn't have a visa to Germany where I was transferring to next flight in same airport and do not need a visa, since I flew to istanbul same way through Berlin airport. But Pegasus makes decisions as such whether you need visa or not, which is outrageous because neither do they have any clue no have a right to perform actions like that. Because of them I missed my flight back to New York from Berlin, had to buy a whole new ticket to fly back home same day that cost me 800 dollars . If I didn't get Pegasus flight back tobegin with, but Turkish airlines or anything else I wouldn't loose so much money at the end",10,"2022",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Advice to avoid this company","Was flying with this airlines from Cappadocia to Istanbul. I payed for the carry-on luggage and also had a small personal item (a bad) with me. The sized for the carry-on luggage were matching the airline's criteria, same as the one for the personal item.

However, the employees told me that I can't pick the personal item with me, as the sizes according to their glance are not correct. I said, please, measure it. They did not even move to do it and just said no, write a review to the company.

Such rudness and disrespect. Ultimately they made me move the carry-on lugges to the hild luggage and take the bag as the personal one. I didn't want it, but was jo choice as the staff there wants to do nothing.

Don't fly with them.",10,"2022",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Respect yourselves- don’t ever fly on this disgusting airline.","I booked a flight from Manchester to Istanbul and it was connecting flight so basically from Manchester to Dalaman on Pegasus airlines and then from Dalaman to Istanbul Turkish airlines. My flight was supposed to fly at 1:05 am but it got delayed with any reason for over 1 hour. And that was my wait time in Dalaman for Turkish. So i missed my Turkish airline flight now here I am buying new ticket and I have to wait for 10 hours.
Staff was rude. Plane was disgusting smelly and dirty.
No free food.
No free water even.
Staff was only nice to those who bought few eating items.
And when I tried to talk to Pegasus, the lady at the airport rudely said and I quoted “it’s not my problem, go call on customer service (and they didn’t pick at all).
Also it’s not cheap. Took £800 from Manchester to Dalaman.
Guys please never ever fly on Pegasus.
I would have given in minus but here I have to give atleast one star ranking.",10,"2022",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Choose a different airline!","Worst airline I’ve ever flew with. Yes, it’s a budget airline but they are really bad. People at counters and flight attendants are very rude. Connecting and other flights were more than an hour late. Worst was when trying to get back to Sharjah from Ercan; because of “weather conditions” they decided to take us to Fujairah just to wait until we could fly into Sharjah instead of letting us do the migration process and get off the plane. We were supposed to arrive at 4am, it’s already 9am and we’re still in the plane.",10,"2022",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Avoid Pegasus- too terrible experience!","Flight from Paris Orly to Sabiha Gokcen was one of the worst in my experience after which I've decided to stop flying by Pegasus at all.
Food is disgusting and overprices, no inclined seats, service is at lowest level possible.
Moreover, Pegasus cancelled our previous flight as of Jan 2021 and we've never got a compensation! We still keep calling and writing letters to pgs.guestrelations@flypgs.com but no reply and, of course, no money!",10,"2022",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Racial discrimination incident","On October 19th, flight# PC1252 my friend and I had been pointed out by few air attendants to the police to remove from our seats, and ordered us to take our belongings to leave the plane involuntarily. Even I demanded for the reason, attendants said nothing, and police told me to shut up. Tried to control myself and obeyed police order to leave plane. But I saw a group of attendants standing by the gate and gave me a pitiful laugh. After we were in police station, we got released on the spot with US passports present. We found out later that attendants convinced my friend and I are associated with another Chinese that they were detained illegally for ""accused stealing"" that he was released after a simple questioning. The whole scene purposedly staged three Chinese passengers as prime suspects, even I sat in 11F by the window with two other passengers next to me, and I was asleep until the chaotic incident happened to me. I just want to say the airlines workers should have sensitive training on various ethnic who are now free to travel as equal to others. We should not be judged by our colors of skin for any incident. I am just an ordinary traveler, and did not deserve being disgraced in front of people over nothing. Those attendants I would not forgive of their callous attitudes. Even we bumped into then ib the arrival hall and asked for explanation and names. One of them yelled shut up. Another one just said you will never our names with laughing face. Yes, I am upset, but plea to Pegasus to strive towards with better service.",10,"2022",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Terrible service","I flight from Istanbul to London. They had a 3 hrs delay, the plane was supposed to arrive at 18:00 and it landed at 21:00. The employees ignored me quiet a lot when I told them that I wasn't feeling well and I needed a cup of water. Once I can get their attention, they charged me 100 Turkish liras for 2 tiny bottles of water, which is really pricey.
I WILL NEVER EVER AGAIN USE THIS AIRLINES.",10,"2022",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Never again","I bought a ticket to Moscow on March 2022 through an agency. The flight was cancelled by the air company and no refund untill now. The agency contacted them but with no result. I paid with my Israeli card, but the company stated that they couln't refund to it, not to Russian bank (obviously), not to Reiffeisen bank's account of my relative. No other compensation. So it was my first attempt to fly with Pegasus and the last one. Never never never again",10,"2022",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst experience of my life","This airline is a disgrace, booked Sharjah to Kayseri with a stop off in Istanbul, we did this so we would stay in Istanbul on the way back and have half a day in cappadocia on the first day of our holiday.

First flight 3 hour delay, meaning we would miss our connection, got to Istanbul and connection was still there so we queued and when trying to enter the plane with our boarding pass there was an error. They had changed our flights without telling us and given our seats away.

Staff were very unhelpful and offered us a pathetic Burger King meal. We are currently 5 hours delay into part 2 of the flight and then told the new flight is delayed.

The airline is a disgrace and has ruined our short holiday. The worst thing is they couldn’t care less.

NEVER USE THEM no matter how cheap!!",10,"2022",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Poor service, unprofessional crew, blow the standard","I have travelled from Erzincan to Sabiha Gokce Airport, the plane was busy so there were not enough space to put our hand luggage, cabin crew Mr Sabri Buyukhiz took our luggage and placed somewhere at the middle without informing us properly , we got stuck as we were at the front seats, when the airport landed people left, we couldnt find our luggage, pegasus took no responsibility, no sorry from Mr Sabri, washed his hands, very unprofessional company, would not recomend anyone.",10,"2022",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","awful attitude towards the clients","The flight never happened. This company keeps ignoring my messages on the refund which took place in March. The flight was cancelled and I requested a refund from them but still haven't got anything. It was not cheap or anything, the cost was approximately 300$. I've sent them the return details three times and every time they're saying ""the refund is on the final stage"" and here we are, nothing. It seems that they simply don't care about their reputation so please don't ever ever use this company. Either way there is a risk of losing money dealing with them.",10,"2022",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst service","We had a terrible experience with Pegasus airlines. Our flight from Alanya to Istanbul was delayed for more than 3 hours.

They don’t care about their customers",10,"2022",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Flight Amsterdam to Istanbul","Small seats, no plane entertainment (you have to use your own phone) and rip-off prices for the foods/drinks on board.

P.S. And yes, it was Pegasus that cancelled the booking and did not fly.",10,"2022",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","No water on board?!","It was my first flight with Pegasus. On the way to Antalya everything was excellent, but the way back was awful.

I have asked for some water, cause I didn’t feel well. A stewardesses asked me to wait for a while, then they started to sell goods, I was still waiting.

Around 40 min later I have asked again and at that moment she told me, I can only buy water, there is no water for free, which is a nonsense! There is always some water on board!

I couldn’t buy it cause I didn’t have cash and Russian cards aren’t working abroad.",10,"2022",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Small seats, annoying customer service, cheap","This is not the first time I have flown with Pegasus. I definitely am aware that this is a flight on a budget and hence no comfort aboard.
I really appreciate the comfort flex option including the flexibility of cancelling and adjusting dates etc. Nevertheless the customer service is horrible. As it is not possible to reach them. Via E-Mail you ONLY get an answer if you are very persistant (I wrote them 3 times) and via the phone you have to wait 40 minutes and from a German number it actually costs a fortune. The contact via phone was great. The exchange via e-mail was horrible:
-Pegasus cancelled our flights 2 weeks before flying.
-I changed the dates and clicked that we would liked to have all conditions carried forward ->Comfort flex with emergency seats.
-I did not receive a confirmation until this day.
-Pegasus did not carry forward the conditions as requested. At least they send me back the money.
-after requesting that these conditions should be added again, they did not reply.
-I requested an answer again and they replied 1 day before my flight. I re-iterated that I would like to have the same conditions.
-the replay came AFTER my flight with the hint that I have already flown. THANKS FOR NOTHING.
- we were also not able to add the conditions at the counter as of course it was already too late.
-furthermore from 4 flights, 3 were delayed. 2 of those by more than 2 hours.

What I am trying to say for everyone else: be aware of what you are buying. If it is to go from A to B cheap, then it is great. Just hope that nothing goes wrong because you will no be supported.",10,"2022",2

"Pegasus-Airlines","four flight trip Ankara","Travelled from Manchester to Ankara via Istanbul using Pegasus and was happy with all aspects of service. I paid for extra legroom on all flights and price was reasonable to do this. Delay in flight out of Manchester but not airlines fault. Staff friendly, planes clean, food ok.
I know this is a budget airline so set my expectations accordingly, I have experienced worse on much more expensive services. Only hiccup was on arrival at Ankara when info on which carousel for baggage collection could have been better, I waited at the same one as most passengers but they were classed as 'Internal Flights' whereas I should have gone to 'International Arrivals', not a big deal and soon sorted.
All my baggage transferred flights without problem and other than Manchester all flights on time.

So I am stuck at the entrancenof the airport with minimum frustructure with no possibility to go to lounges and wait for my next flight comfortable because I can't give my language in. I am sorry no ticket with Pegasus should cost 1000€ only for them to keep you language for 6 hours connection... it is a budget company with pricing of luxury companies. In pegasus seats don't recline, plains are quite dirty and delays delays delays, also always the fathers away gate possible and all of this if fine for small price but for several thousands of euro this is a joke!

"Pegasus-Airlines","Wonderful compared to BA !","Having read Tripadvisor reviews we were a bit apprehensive about booking with Pegasus but were very pleasantly surprised. We primarily booked with Pegasus because Stansted is our local airport and the departure time suited us. We booked the option of reserving seats which included a snack (sandwich) and the cost was around GBP 200 total cheaper than BA for our two seats one-way.
The flight was about 75% full and the cabin crew service was
good, the drink selection was fine and at decent prices and just about enough legroom. It was a great way to start our holiday !

"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst experience of my life","There was not enough time to get onto the connecting flight from where I got dropped off at the airport from flight 1.

I asked for help and for the whole day, I was told to go to different departments in the airport as that specific one couldn't help. Finally I was given directions to the supervisor who refused to help me and laughed at me whilst speaking to the other staff members about me. I just wanted just one option of what I can do next but they wouldn't give me anything at all.

The supervisor said the words ""I don't need to know that you don't have money. That is irrelevant information,"" when I asked for help on what I could do. The whole day, I had to walk around almost having a panic attack with no help given at all.

They then kept my cabin luggage at the airport (refusing to even talk to me at this point) and I had to get another flight to my destination. For almost one month, I've been trying to get a hold of them to just send my luggage back and they still haven't done so. I am losing an incredible amount of money as my work equipment is in there as well as a camera that I have to pay late rental costs for each day.

Also, on the way there they FORGOT to take my sister's luggage off the plane when we got to our destination and and to wait almost a week to get it back. No compensation was given.

Currently, whenever I try to call, I get put on hold for an extremely long time or I get told ""there's something wrong with the connection"" or ""there's nothing we can do.""

They are literally doing nothing about this situation and keeping my luggage hostage. I've tried every form of contact and I'm hoping that a review would get their attention because I have no options anymore.

Staff were nice and friendly everyone got a complimentary drink due to the flight being late. Luggage arrived at Antalya without delay. Return flight departure was on time.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Pegasus violates the passengers rights","Flight PC1223 from Istanbul SAW to Rome FCO at 11.55 am on 04 September 2022, deliberately denied me boarding out of spite. The stewardess had closed the doors 1 minute earlier, the plane still attached to the finger, with the door open and heels on. On board the passengers were still standing to settle down and my travel colleagues repeatedly warned the cabin crew that we were at the gate. Out of spite, pegasus preferred to delay the departure of the flight by more than 15 minutes to unload my luggage rather than taking 2 minutes to allow me and another passenger to board. The very serious thing is that no announcements have been made of either the start of boarding or the last call and that the hostess treated us like beasts, denying us explanations, information on baggage recovery and any re-routing. While I was in despair she turned her back smiling at my situation without giving me attention and making fun of me. Rude staff, completely unfit to carry out their work. I stayed 16 minutes at the gate watching the plane stand still with the hatch open as they unloaded my luggage. I had to look for a flight on my own without assistance, sleep at the airport and not even been given a little water. It is shameful and your attitude has been denounced to ICAO and ENAC.",9,"2022",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst airline ever, incompetent","I was blocked from boarding the plane until I paid 3kg extra fee even though my ticket clearly states that I have the right to 8kg (The cabin baggage not exceeding the mentioned sizes).
When I found out that I got scammed, They told me it was an error from the agent and why you are complaining about it and asked for a refund. It's very cheap what you paid But when I insisted they confirm that i will get a refund cash when i come back to Istanbul. Okay i come back 5 days later they told oh sorry the system is down we can transfer the money to any account later. but now they told sorry we can't you need to have your own bank account. Pegasus have a very bad customer service .",9,"2022",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","THE WORST airline EVER!","We were on our honeymoon, my husband and I arrived to the counter where our tickets are issued. we previously booked and paid tickets for both of us. However, when we arrived at the counter, they said that there is no place for us on the plane because we didn't book seats we only booked tickets. They were over booked. but this is not our problem! we paid for our tickets! they issued a ticket for me but not for my husband! we explained that we are on honeymoon we cannot go separately and we had hot air balloon reservation in Cappadocia that we lost ! they forced us to transit for 10 hours in Istanbul before going to Cappadocia.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Poor","Pros:
Cheaper than other airlines

Cons:
Delay - 2 hours
Seats are really small
No leg space
Water should be free, we paid £2 for a small water bottle
Staff were rude. They opened both doors into the plane which was a disaster because we were in a stand still as no one could get to their seats (people who had seats at the front of the plane were entering through the back and vice versa)
Broke my luggage handle
No contact number to complain even though I did contact them before we went on holiday",9,"2022",1

"Pegasus-Airlines","Terrible","Unfortunately, the route is flown only by two airlines, one of which is Pegasus and the other THY.
They have formed a Kartell and are robbing the people.
For both airlines, the ticket prices for longer distances are cheaper than flying elsewhere.
Online check is is available, but when you go to the airport you get in the norma que with other people and do your check in again.

Pagasus advertises as a cheap airline. It is true for everything except its prices.
All kinds of service is CHEAP in QUALITY.

They even charge you €2 for a glass of water.

If you have other options DO NOT FLY WITH PEGASUS.",9,"2022",2

"Pegasus-Airlines","Great flight, horrible air hostesses","The flight itself went very smoothly and the plane was in good condition. However, the air hostesses have a terrible attitude towards their job and the passengers on the aircraft.

After that they rebooked us on another flight but could not provide us any information about our connecting flight to a final destination so we have to fly to Istambul from London to find out about the rest of our travel as no one knows anything ! To be continued as we are yet to get to Istambul and I am expecting it to be a big mess as this has been so far! Costing us 2 days of our holiday due to utter incompetence of everyone that works for the airline. It seems nobody knows , nobody cares attitude going on",9,"2022",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","DELAYS ALWAYS. It is unusual rather I have never seen Pegasus airlines on Time.","It’s the worst airlines, few of the staff doesn’t have manners to treat the guests. Rude, unprofessional and always late. Plus they do not even compensate if they are late. They show the flight on time and once you are inside, just an hour before the flight they show delay time of an hour and after half and hour it will delay even more. They do it because they have a policy of compensation only if the flight is 2 hour late. Till the plane flys, it’s already 2.5 hours late. All the flights which I booked were late, unfortunately I booked them all way before.",9,"2022",1

Never flying pegasus or any Turkish airline again. flight was delayed for 2 hours and I was very late to get back home. Everyone was so ignorant and untethered one of the ladies working their told me to hurry up and that I'm wasting her time even though I was the first to board the plane....

I dont even rate this a 1 I rate Pegasus a 0

"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst Airline and Airport On Earth","The worst airline on earth and including Sabiha airport. The ground staff where terrible and utterly rude. I missed my connecting flight because of the previous delayed flight from Sweden and the airport was super packed to make it on time for my next flight. After missing my flight, I went to Pegasus offices and asked for my luggage but they said they couldn’t give it to me, that it was my responsibility to go claim it myself. Unfortunately that was impossible because I didn’t have a Turkish visa since I was just on transit so I couldn’t exit to the baggage belt. The man from Pegasus office was super rude to everyone and actually made a Canadian mother of three cry and another older Lebanese lady. Anyways, spent the night at the airport little to my surprise it wasn’t just the Pegasus staff that were rude but majority of the airport staff in Sabiha. Really not sure how they were raised. They were inhumane and it almost felt like they were doing us a favor yet it’s the other way round that we paid for their services and it’s our right to seek information from them. I will never recommend this place to anyone. They have lost my baggage and I am still waiting to hear from them. Based on the luggage tag number they issued me when I checked in at Stockholm they haven’t been able to track it , so not sure who’s to blame here and what to do next. They even have print outs on the Pegasus offices desks written that questions aren’t permitted. I’m really disappointed in them and angry at the same time.",8,"2022",1

"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst Experience - NASTY people.","I was shocked by what is considered acceptable treatment of human beings by the Pegasus staff at both the airline AND the Sabiha Gokcen Airport. I was on a connecting flight, like many other people. On several occasions, staff MISDIRECTED people exiting the aircraft, and laughed about it knowing that the passengers didn't understand they were being messed with since they didn't understand the language. At one point, a very nice man from Macedonia tried to exit the aircraft and enter the security line (yes, you have to do it again if you are on a transfer Pegasus flight). The security guard would not let him through and said he needed to go to the ""TRANSFER DESK"". He had a boarding pass, so he did not need to go to the transfer desk. Regardless, he did, and the transfer desk had an 1:30 long line because the desk attendants were not doing their jobs. There was all sorts of screaming going on at the front of the line between a British woman and an agent because the desk agent would not print her ticket. The woman had been at the desk trying to get the ticket for three hours, but the desk agent was playing on her phone and ignoring the woman AND the 300+ person line. Eventually the British woman started filming her out of disbelief (to no avail). Honestly, the screaming was pretty bad which I do not condone, but she was in the right. One of the male agents was also on his phone, and when it was my turn to get my boarding pass, he ignored me, despite my several polite ""excuse mes"", until another agent called me over. Finally after getting my boarding pass and being in line for an hour and a half (yes, TONS of people missed their connection flights), the Macedonian gentleman and myself went back to the security line. The Macedonia gentleman was upset because he waited in the long line and was told at the transfer desk that HE NEVER EVEN NEEDED TO GO TO THE DESK SINCE HE HAD HIS BOARDING PASS ALREADY. So he was upset, and asked the security guard why he sent him there, and the guard shrugged his shoulders and then smiled. Then he looked away and refused to make eye contact. After all this debauchery (BTW the poor British lady was still at the desk even after I left), I finally go through security and went to my gate. At my gate, I went to the desk to speak with an agent about a question I had. The Pegasus agent, a different one, AGAIN ignored me. I must have waited patiently for 6/7 minutes before I said ""excuse me"". He knew I was there but was purposefully ignoring me. After I spoke, he looked up, then looked back down and continued to ignore me. I eventually gave up. One of the Turkish passengers who had watched me said "" you shouldn't smile and be nice to people. They will take it as a weakness and that is why you were ignored"". What about customer service? I was completely appalled by the nasty people from this airline, and their complete inability to do their jobs. I will never take this airline again, and if you need to make a connecting flight, DO NOT TRAVEL PEGASUS because you will miss it, and they do not care.",8,"2022",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Superb customer service from one particular employee","This review is for one particular employee at Antalya airport.
Mehmet Duran Yigitoglu went above and beyond to make sure I made my flight.
Arriving at Analya airport we were sent to the wrong international terminal, there are 2 for your information. Pegasus flights to London are from Terminal 1 we were sent to 2. I had to take a taxi from terminal 2 to 1 as I had literally 15 minutes for my flight to leave. With my sister in law following in her car.
Arriving at Terminal 1 we were then wrongly directed to the internal flights not international by a lady who worked at the information desk of Pegasus.
Another run to the international section with my luggage that was to be handed in but the check in desks were closed. An absolute nightmare, I was literally nearly crying!
Thank goodness we asked for help from Mehmet Duran Yigitoglu, he was my night in shining armour! He took my suitcase, ran with us and got us through all security checks and made sure they also took my suitcase ( I did have to open my suitcases and get it checked but who cares!)
This young man needs to be given a raise and promoted! Thank you so much for this wonderful customer service.",8,"2022",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Needs improvement in every way","Used them for the first ( and last) time for return to Manchester. Very poor overall experience.
Flights were delayed with limited updates or explanations.
Crew were very rude and spoke limited English. A single mum struggled to get into her seat, with the baby on her lap and a huge bag, I was surprised to see the crew went past her with no attention. We helped the mum out.
Seats were the most uncomfortable I have ever sat on board a plane.
As a general rule, 4 hour flights are supposed to be provided with a meal. Not for this airlines it seems, as you have to pay extra.
Not using them ever again as there are plenty of other choices with better value for money.",8,"2022",2

"Pegasus-Airlines","飞马航空是最差的航空公司","2022年8月，乘坐了2次土耳其飞马航空，一次由第比利斯飞往伊斯坦布尔，另一次由伊斯坦布尔飞迪拜，我们家4人居住在迪拜，去过的国家超过20个，廉价航空、优质航空都尝试过不少，飞马航空是廉价航空最差的

飞马航空A321的飞机比亚航的A320飞机除了多装乘客，豪无舒适感，
1、座位非常狭窄，且座位弯曲状，腰都难挺直
2、座椅完全不能调节，超过3小时的飞行让你苦不堪言
3、餐桌是特别的小，不能伸缩，前面的椅背放不了任何物品
4、餐饮时间，他们只专心现场贩卖食品、饮品，而我们提前在购买机票的时候已经支付的食物和饮品迟迟没有人送来，催促5次，等了半小时才送来，如果不提醒他们，他们好像完全不打算给我们送食物过来，不只我们是这样，所有提前购买食物的旅客都是最后才收到食物，他们只关心现场购买食物的旅客。
5、通宵飞行，机舱全部时间灯火通明，完全没有旅客睡眠的时间，贩卖食品、饮品不停在你身边经过询问你要不要。
6、飞机降落时，有些旅客完全没有系安全带，躺平在3个座位上，空乘人员视若无睹。
7、食品不新鲜，里面的酸青瓜变味
8、 冷气几乎感受不到，个个说热

总结：土耳其飞马航空，没有任何服务质量，比亚航、印尼狮航、新加坡Jet star等差了几倍以上

建议： Flydubai (阿联酋航空旗下的廉价航空），可以去到同样的地方。

In August 2022, I flew Turkish Pegasus Airlines twice, one from Tbilisi to Istanbul and the other from Istanbul to Dubai. Our family of 4 persons lives in Dubai and has been to more than 20 countries, low-cost airlines, High-quality airlines have tried a lot, Pegasus Airlines is the worst low-cost airline

The A321 of Pegasus Airlines is more comfortable than the A320 of Air Asia Airline, except that it has more passengers.
1. The seat is very narrow, and the seat is curved, and it is difficult to straighten the waist
2. The seat cannot be adjusted at all, and the flight of more than 3 hours will make you miserable
3. The dining table is very small and cannot be stretched, and the back of the chair in front cannot hold any items
4. During the meal time, they only focus on selling food and drinks on the spot, and the food and drinks that we paid for when we purchased the ticket in advance were not delivered. We urged 5 times and waited for half an hour before they were delivered. They, they don't seem to plan to bring us food at all, not only us, all the passengers who bought food in advance are the last to receive the food, they only care about the passengers who buy food on the spot.
5. Flying all night, the cabin is brightly lit all the time, there is no time for passengers to sleep, and food and drinks are constantly passing by to ask you if you want it.
6. When the plane landed, some passengers did not wear seat belts at all, lying flat on the three seats, and the flight attendants turned a blind eye.
7. The food is not fresh, and the sour cucumber inside is stale
8. The air-conditioning can hardly be felt, all of them say it is hot

Summary: Turkish Pegasus Airlines, without any service quality, worse than Air Asia Airline, Indonesia Lion Air, Singapore Jetstar.

Suggestion: Flydubai (the low-cost airline owned by Emirates), can go to the same place.",8,"2022",1

"Pegasus-Airlines","Never again , I value my life and my family’s life.","So I travelled with an infant and my toddler from Karachi to Copenhagen yesterday. From start the flight crew was not so cooperative , from letting us board we were met with shouting angry staff , quite fed up of the passengers. Thank God we had already paid for extra leg room seats so no problem there. The plane does not have bassinet , i repeat does not have bassinet - so you have to keep on carrying your infant thruout the flight which for me was around 6 hours one flight and 4 hours the other and the 4 hours of transit time since no play area or even a safe area to lay your infant and rest at Sabina gokcen. The seats are quite small and breastfeeding in that space was a very agonizing and painful thing for me to do since I had to sit sideways to feed my baby so as to not hurt her head or feet , my back is literally sore rn. The air cabin crew did help as much as they could by being polite but the lack of comfort in the plane could not be justified by anything. We had a very bad turbulence incident during the flight where people starting crying shouting and praying to Allah. Upon inquiring since the weather was complete fine , the crew informed it was the bad weather. Everyone speculated the pilot had dozed off after putting plane on auto since the weather was very good , plus no seatbelt sign had been turned on beforehand - which the crew normally informs in case of coming bad weather. Anyway the entire flight was generally not smooth and even the flight form Istanbul to Copenhagen there was general turbulence. I kept praying for safe journey and a promise to never take this airline again. The transit at Sabina gokcen was very painful which you can find in google reviews. I would suggest please avoid this airline if you’re traveling with kids especially infants since they do not cater to mothers or infants. Can you imagine I had to pee while having my baby in her harness since no one from the crew was willing to hold her while I pee ? I mean …. I realized I can do a lot in terms of taking care of my kids and all but no I don’t want to do this every time I travel. I’d rather have a bit more of traveling time
Probably two layovers and take Qatar airways. I felt unsafe , extremely uncomfortable in every way during this entire trip. So saving some extra buck and time does not make up for the agony one goes thru during flight. In flight entertainment is also quite pathetic. You can see the pics below how weirdly uncomfortable I am while holding my infant",8,"2022",1

Rude for absolutely no reason.. specifically 2 that clearly have no communication skills and don’t suit to be doing jobs that are client facing. On top of that I had packed valuable belongings in my carry on and was forced to send it to cargo because they didn’t have space for more carry- ons onboard, how odd!

They sent another suitcase on the 23rd telling him his case is on it’s way, this was someone else’s case not his, not the same size, colour, make or remotely similar. We haven’t seen his case since ( 27/7/22 ) now. We have been promised return calls from claims teams at Pegasus that never happen. We have spent over £300 on phone calls to Istanbul and even drove to Manchester airport to try and speak to someone for help. If you email them all return emails are In Turkish.

Pretending to help you out but actually you can feel and see that they are forced to do it only because they have to. Turkey is and will always be very far from joining the EU with these people around. Yes its a cheaper option but comes with bad service. You can book with them if you cab guarantee everything will run smoothly. Delayed flights and changing of gates is normal. Rude behavior and shouting in Turkish also normal. Unhappy face expressions and lack of English is also normal. Seems like the qualifying skill they require when hiring is ""do you know how to speak? Ok, you are hired"".

They informed me that my booking had been cancelled - without informing me at the time! Had I not phoned to query it, I would be none the wiser - I had a booking reference and everything - so what gave them the right to cancel without telling me. They said the flight was full. Really? It’s July and Ive booked a flight for November!! They couldn’t tell me when I would get my refund or why their system was showing spaces on the flight and yet mine was cancelled.

However, the app kept telling us ""New flight and reissued flight is the same. Please select a different flight (ERR20375)"", which was incorrect. This happened several times, and our multiple attempts to reach the call centre (using our hotel's landline number) resulted to very long waiting times so we gave up.

Through these two hours of waiting and re-trying, the ESB - MCT tickets had increased by 10%!

Afraid the prices would keep increasing, we cancelled our SAW - MCT flights and book fresh tickets for ESB - MCT. This resulted to us paying TRY 1100 per pax (around 28%!) more compared to changing the flight directly.

While our experience on the ground and onboard was reasonably good (typical LCC), our experience with the app was horrible. We're not even sure if we could get anything back from the extra money we paid due to the horrible app.",7,"2022",2

"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst airline staff, both ground and cabin","The ground staff at counter needs to be trained and given training on how to deal with customers

They are rude, irrational and impolite.
Have not been taught to work with smile on faces
Unwelcoming attitude is something that is the biggest put off when you are traveling not for free.",7,"2022",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","They lost our luggage with valuble and sentimental value","Pegagus Airlines lost our luggage 9 weeks ago now, our luggage was 25kg and had an overall high value of items plus sentimental items. Pegasus advised they they would pay us £300! Explained this did not cover barely anything and sent them receipts for our items! Have continued to chase and have recieved nothing back!!

Customer service is extremely bad! We trusted them with our luggage and never expected to not get our things back! Some that cannot be replaced with money. A very bad ending to a great holiday.

We were advised that our luggage got placed on to the plane so how is it possible for it not to come off the plane!!!

Tip for company (put employees on customer service courses )",7,"2022",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","TERRIBLE!! Avoid at all costs","My experience with Pegasus has been an absolute nightmare. Firstly, staff is so unprofessional, very rude and completely opposite of helpful in every case. They let you go through check in and security with 2 carry on bags, not telling you anything and then saying you can only take 1 bag at the gate. Easy way to make a passenger pay £67 for each bag they have. Rude stewardess, asked for water and had to wait until the two of them finished chatting, then bothered to get up after 2 minutes to do her job. delayed flight with 2 hours because of them misplacing suitcases and overall a total nightmare. They try to make you pay for everything, with some illogical reasons. Never flying with them again in a million years. I would rate it 0 if it was possible.",7,"2022",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Overall poor experience","Staff has been quite rude to other customers that I saw at the airport. At the information desk I saw a lady yell at a Romanian family for missing their flight(gates had changed and they ended up missing their flight). I was shocked. Most staff I encountered spoke very little english.

Unfortunately, I had missed my flight as well. The checking group was unfortunately very unsympathetic and so was the Pegasus customer service person near the entrance, who told me to get another ticket.

Also, once I booked for the flight the next day, during take off, a lady became ill. As a doctor, I was asked to review her and make sure it didn't require an emergency landing.

After I saw her, I returned to my seat and not so much as a thank you nor a glass of water. I don't believe in receiving special treatment, but if you ask someone for help, just say ""thanks"".",7,"2022",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Unhelpful team","I have never been so disappointed with an airline in my whole life, I chose Pegasus thinking they would be good and having not read the reviews I was totally wrong. They didn’t let me on the flight because I hadn’t fill in a country entry form. I had my passport, proof of PCR, Proof of vaccine and proof of hotel. I have now paid a significant amount more to travel and I now how to transit at Istanbul to get to Qatar. I will never be using Pegasus again and I hope no one else does either. The customer service was appalling!!!",7,"2022",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Avoid it if you can","First the sabiha airoort is trash, the Pegasus is also bad.problem with check in and the workers are not friendly non professional. The hole package is bad.",7,"2022",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Good Service","After Easyjet cancelled our flight I looked for an alternative and found Pegasus flying from Stansted to Hurghada via Istanbul. Check-in was one of the quickest ever and the flight left on time. Transfer at Istanbul was easy. Check-in at Hurghada was also very quick. The return flight was delayed one hour leaving Hurghada but this was not the fault of Pegasus. This left only 1.5 hours to transfer at Istanbul but this was easy.

The seats on the aircraft did not recline and were not particularly comfortable but no worse than Ryanair or Easyjet.

The flight was only a little more expensive that Easyjet and included 20kg luggage.

Having endured the awful service from Easyjet in recent years it was refreshing to fly with Pegasus although the flight times and transfers made it less convenient. I will certainly consider using them again.",7,"2022",3

"Pegasus-Airlines","A definitely NO for long trips","I had the misfortune of ten hours of flying each way. While these planes would be just fine for a quick one or two hour flight they are not at all suitable for long trips.

* No screens or inflight entertainment
* No charging points for electronic devices
* Food is not provided and what you can buy is pricey.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Impressed with the service!","I read a lot of bad reviews about Pegasus Airlines and was very sceptical, but as the prices of the flights were so affordable, I decided to risk it and I was very pleasantly surprised.
We didn’t pay for seats and when we checked in online, unlike other low budget aitlines, we were given seats together. Airport staff were efficient and flight attendants friendly. The prices of snacks and drinks on board were also affordable. On our return journey, we had connecting flight from Tblisi via Istanbul (we travelled from Istanbul to Tblisi with another airline) to London, and again we were given seats together for both flights. When we arrived at the airport, Pegasus staff changed our seats to emergency exit at no extra cost for the first leg of our journey, they wanted to do the same for the second one but seats weren’t available. Our bags were tagged with ‘transfer’ signs and we didn’t have to do anything but collect at our final destination - Stansted Airport.
I must say that I had very low expectations but was very pleasantly surprised and I would definitely use the airline again!",6,"2022",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst airline on earth","Honestly one of the worst experiences of my entire life !! Stuck in tons of Istanbul traffic and got to the airport at 10 minutes before bay drop off closed!! The check in refused to accept the bags and had to speak to the counter !! The person helping us took 10 minutes to look up from counting money in her purse and then without explanation booked us on a later flight, she was rude, mean and hostile !! And also charged us all different amounts for the new flight !! Also paid for extra baggage and meal but got none of it !! Didn’t get the sandwich I paid for !! Also when you go to the check in counter, the line control person keeps sending you to various different counters !! It’s a terrible airline !! Don’t fly with it unless you desperate !!",6,"2022",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Bad bad bad","Airline does not have any customer service they do not offer any drinks or meals and then they do you want to pay for it they do not have equipment to do the transaction taken a Credit card they are always off-line and doesn’t work and then they make you pay cash which is higher price than credit card however they don’t even have a chance to give you back the change so usually a drink will cost you minimum of five bucks or 10 nomination that you have
At the counter there is no smile whatsoever there is no hi there is no bye even when they have their own mistake which is they cannot find the name of the passenger although you have tickets showing that you are on the flight you have to be able to communicate with the customer the second language is first language they don’t even speak English and when they do they do not make sense
Overall I would not recommend anybody to play with this airline the only reason you want to fly you think it’s cheaper than any other airline however it’s better to pay a little bit more but be comfortable
Sincerely
I’m not a customer again",6,"2022",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Do not choose Pegasus Airlines","Pegasus airlines does not understand common curtesy. My wife, two kids, and I had just gotten off another flight with Turkish airlines and were rushing to get to our connecting flight with Pegasus airlines. Our Turkish airlines flight was delayed and in the midst of checking in with Pegasus, the check in locked. I was only able to get one boarding pass, leaving my kids and wife without one. I would never get on the flight without the rest of my family. I spoke with the manager and he was absolutely no help. He claimed there was nothing he could do and there was no manual way he as the manager could override the system even though it had just locked. Our seats were still there, there was still plenty of time before the flight, and there was no reason not to let us in. Even if this was the case, which I doubt, they showed no compassion and were rushing to brush us aside with no assistance. They lacked even the bare minimum of flexibility that every customer would expect and refunded us for only 216 Turkish liras (about $13 in total for all four of us).",6,"2022",1

We went to the enquiry desk they made us wait 2 hours. Then manager came we thought he was going to help us but he was even worse he took us 3 woman down stairs and we through we were getting on s flight but he sent us on a while goose chase we went from one manager to another but they were all very rude and for us of saying it's not there fault treating us to call the police and get arrested.

3. Free change of ticket- LIE- 100$ per change
4.Rude customer support. They are yelling and barely know English. Feeling very untitled like most of this nation. I don’t see a reason why.
5. My husband today traveled with them again. Really bad landing and he asked for 1 bottle of water he gave them 10 euros the water it’s 2 they didn’t gave him the change with the reason that they don’t have. But they are stealing you in any other way possible.",6,"2022",1

"Pegasus-Airlines","Never again - rip off!","First time I've written a review, especially this negative, but I couldn't help myself. On a recent trip to Germany, I had to add an extra suitcase for my flight back and couldn't believe it when they asked 140 EUR (!) for one suitcase for a trip from DUS to TLV over Istanbul. I was literally debating with myself for hours if I can manage with the one suitcase I had already paid for, in order not to pay this exaggerated amount, but I had to do it in the end and I'm still angry about it to this day. The ticket itself was already extraordinary expensive and don't get me started on the unnecessary 14 EUR or something for a seat reservation (per leg).
Competing low cost airlines flying the same or similar route are charging 30-50 EUR for an extra suitcase.
I've flown with them before, planes and the flight itself are ok (about what you would expect from a ""low cost"" airline), but after this, never again.",5,"2022",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Very Poor would be a compliment!","Very poor service, would not fly again. Have reported poor service to my business travel agent. Had to pay upfront for a seat selection and them at check in was allocated a different, inferior seat. Website/app would bot allow on line check in. Staff at Stansted were rude. Don't be fooled by their ""low cost"" claims.",5,"2022",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","If you have a layover and need extra luggage be SUPER careful","The customer support will not side with you and keep the extra money you had to pay.

I've never actually wrote a review about a airline company before in my life, but this time I felt like I had to warn others.

I had a indirect flight with a single layover, both were Pegasus.
During the online check-in I was shown both flights, but was only able to check in on the first one which got me to the layover destination.

I needed extra luggage weight, so I ordered it during the check-in. Paid 31 euros to get 5KG extra for two check-in bags.

Upon arriving at the airport, I was told that I only purchased extra weight for the first flight but not the second one. I was shocked. How are you able to purchase only for one flight when the system knows you have a layover?

I was even more shocked how much of a scam the prices are when you have to pay it at the airport. I had to pay 80 euros for the second flight! We had to take the flight so what can I do? I agreed to pay in the hopes that Pegasus would understand this unfortunate situation and give us back the money. And if not, at least give us 50 euros back to make it match the online booking.

But no, my request got declined. Phone support was terrible saying that they were unable to redirect me to anyone available that would help me with this case. I had to contact the booking website according to them, even though they had NOTHING to do with his transaction.

I will never fly with Pegasus again, this was an absolute scam. Support was terrible, and response to e-mail has taken almost a month.

Will definitely tell all my relatives and friends to avoid this airline at ALL costs. At least this way I will get my money back indirectly.",5,"2022",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Should have chosen Turkish airlines instead","Yesterday connecting flight from Munich stopped by the boarding bridge, but they let us disembarked and use the bus. Also, today’s flight was delayed by 4 hours without any proper explanation from the company",5,"2022",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Be careful scam on the website","If I could put zero I would!

I had to change my flight, which I tried to do on their website, twice! I have been charged (twice) of the amount and never receive any confirmation. They took the money and didn't change the flight date as it was supposed to be.
I had to change it in the office of the airport, paying again the amount of the date modification.

At the airport everybody refused to help me, even to understand what happened. They kept telling me that they are not responsible, it is a check in zone. The sale office told me that they didn't see any paiement from me on the company account... Call center say that the money is not on their account, that the money might be back by 48h..but still, on My bank account it is obviously deduced 2 times at the name of ""pegasus"" and still not refunded.
It costed me a lot of money an no body seem to even care!
Huge scam!! Be careful",5,"2022",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Do not trust their web payments","They have taken the ticket fee 4 different times from my credit card. They didn't issue any ticket.
When I complained on the phone, they told me they would pay my money back in 48 hours. They caused me to go over my credit limit!
They paid me back only after 3 days and due to commissions and currency exchange rates, I lost more than 70 $Cad.
I complained about it, they answered me after 2 weeks to tell me they wşll not pay me back the money they caused me to lose.

Previously this company had sold me twice the ""in-flight entertainment"" without providing the service. Since they seemed economic, I had not cared that much. Now they caused me to lose money and I realize that this company cannot be trusted at all. From now on I will avoid Pegasus.",5,"2022",1

The onboarding staff was so racist and refused to do their job, and unfortunately they refuse to allow me board my flight even though I was more than an hour early, they said I had to change the flight to another date which apparently cost me more money. I saw the reviews but still wanted to give them a benefit of doubt. This was my first time taking this flight and will be the last. Please DO NOT TAKE THIS FLIGHT, most of the reviews are terrible and that goes to show you what people really experience with this awful people.

She was extremely rude and literally screaming at passengers who were just behind me including myself with no respect whatsoever... Just upset and rude as if we were in a free ride

Customer service is very important and such behaviors should not be acceptable if she had issues she should have not been assined for this flight...

This is my first time with pegasus airline and it should not be the last one I hope..

I begged if they let me get on the plane and have my luggage delivered by next flight and said I didn’t care how much it’d cost. But no one was there to help. In the end bought the next flight by Qatar airways at twice the amount I had paid for my round ticket just to get there in time for the wedding.

The staff have an excellent talent for making passengers feel more like an irritation and inconvenience rather than paying customers. All of us were shouted at like naughty school children at the gate on one occasion. I would only fly with this airline again if all other options were unviable.

Besides there is a clear lack of responsibility. I would never travel with this airline again.",4,"2022",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Another warning about this low cost, nothing gained airline","I purchased the Comfort-flex ticket in December for £22, and in March I received an email stating that my flight was cancelled. I could rebook on another flight or get a refund.

I chose rebooking, and paid £3 extra for an open ticket with option to cancel.
The new ticket was not like for like however, no meal, no seat booking.
I tried to cancel and the refund was £2.

So I paid £3 for an option that would refund less than the fee. And Comfort-flex? I asked them to carry it over and did not get a reply.",4,"2022",1

"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst ever","By far the worst airline , save your monies , for one they are always delayed somehow for some unknown reason , not only that , we called them twice before our flight to make sure our pet didn’t need any payment and they said no , he has his passports and health pass which they told us was all he needed . On the day of the flight (my birthday !!) they just told us we couldn’t get in with him , he had to pay something , mind you we checked in and they saw us , and said nothing , my boyfriend had to stay behind to try and fix it and get a later flight which they made him pay , this is by far the worst airline in history",4,"2022",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Avoid using this useless airline","The worst airline you can ever use. Full of stress and staff are racist and rude. The reason why it’s cheap is that the airport is giving them the furthest point to take off and land and also the baggage is last to be collected because all airports are giving prior to those airlines that pays little extra. So long story short the Pegasus airline is rubish enough not giving priority to their customers and passengers.
Pegasus Airline don’t care about your TIME.",4,"2022",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","good for short-haul basic flights at a low cost","I needed to fly from Switzerland to Istanbul and the options I found were either Turkish or Pegasus. I have flown on Turkish many times (in both Business and Economy) and will probably fly them again in the future but have never experienced Pegasus so decided to try them out. Pegasus is a low-cost airline based out of Istanbul's second airport - Sabiha Gokcen Airport. Being low-cost means that they offer a lower fare for the flight but that nothing is included except for your seat and a personal carry-on. Additional hand luggage, checked baggage, meals, picking your seat - all of that comes at an extra cost. I was not looking forward to the low-cost experience, but it was a direct flight from Zurich, the departure and return timings were good, and the flight was about 2.5hrs long. This plus there was a significant price difference between Pegasus and Turkish.

It was really easy to go through and book my ticket online and manage my trip through the app - I did

want to say that my Western credit card did think that Pegasus was potentially fraud so that was the only hiccup in the booking process. Since I was only going for a short period, I did not need to add any extras to my ticket so I did not purchase the extra hand-carry or the checked baggage; there are packages which provide everything including checked baggage and seat selection and I have chosen these on other low-cost carriers but did not need to on this journey.

I was able to check-in 24-hours prior to my flight but need to check-in at the desk again to show my health documents, check my documents, and obtain my boarding pass. During check-in I was assigned a seat and I was assigned an aisle seat which was fine with me; had I been assigned a middle seat I probably could have switched it at the airport. Documents checked and after security I proceeded to the gate. The plane arrived from Istanbul, deplaned, was 'cleaned' and then we started our boarding process. The flight was schedule to depart Zurich at 11:45a and arrive into Istanbul at 4:35pm. The flight boarded a little behind schedule but quickly everyone got to their seats and we pushed back. Turkish airlines have always had a 'flexible on-time' departure and Pegasus was no different; it was what I have come to expect so if we depart close to the scheduled departure time then I considered it on-time.

The operating plane was an Airbus A320 on the outbound and a Boeing 737 on the return, both with a 3-3 seat configuration. I did not see a business class section so I am assuming that its an all economy class configuration. The seats were basic like a low-cost carrier with a section for magazines/safety card, menu, tray table, and a small pocket below that. The Airbus was definitely more comfortable than the Boeing with the seats being more comfortable and the legroom a bit better; although it is low-cost so do not expect much. There is no seatback entertainment but you could stream certain movies and TV shows through your personal device; the free content was extremely limited but you could pay to access more shows. The only thing with using your own device is that I did not see any power outlets nor USB ports to recharge your device so make sure it is fully charged prior to boarding. Once airborne, the inflight service commenced. As with all low-cost airlines, nothing is free and everything is buy-on-board. A lot of passengers were buying onboard or had prepurchased meals and so it looked very popular. The inflight purchase happened twice, once as soon as we took off and again prior to landing.

Overall, it was a standard low-cost flight experience with Pegasus. Given the short flight time, the fact

I was only going for a little while, and it was a direct flight I did not mind the flight. Had the flight time been longer, my stay in Turkey longer and I needed to add more services, or I needed to transit in Istanbul then Pegasus would not be my first choice. With low-cost airlines, you have to know what you are getting into and choose them for what they do best. In my opinion, they are good for short-haul basic flights at a low cost and that is what Pegasus delivered.",3,"2022",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Bad experience","Worst flight experience ever.

"Pegasus-Airlines","The worst airline ever.","Due to weather, my flight from Turkey to Georgia was delayed 16hrs. I tried to contact Pegasus offices in different countries and no one was answering. After several hours, they told me that they will provide me with a hotel room.
After arriving in Turkey, I spent 3hrs searching for someone to help me, but non of the Pegasus workers were in their offices and no one gave me clear answers. I arrived at the hotel, it was good and all, but they told us that they will provide us with breakfast, lunch, and dinner, but they always try to find a lie to say to avoid giving us food. So I stayed without food for almost 24hrs because a 5 stars hotel doesn’t have food!!! and it’s almost impossible to find any restaurants around the area.
While returning from Georgia to Turkey so I can go from there back to Beirut, the flight was delayed for 3hrs and they made me pay 95$ for 5kg that they could have let in without any payment.

It's not okay to have 4~5 extra kilograms, but it's okay to stay without food for 24hrs, and it's okay to cancel flights last minute righttttt?

I don’t recommend this airline and I would never use it again.

Writing this with tears.",3,"2022",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Book someone else","I will avoid Pegasus of possible. Canceling legs of our trip and the only alternative is 8 hours later. Last minute flight cancellations. Our last flight when I checked in they had assigned someone else the seat on my ticket and argued with me to prove I'd paid to select my seat. Their operations are poor and their unreliable. I will always avoid them when possible.",3,"2022",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Horrible experience","The worst flight experience. 2 flights and both several hours delayed. They came by for food and beverages. They didn't had the 2 meals I asked for, and I was very hungry :( I payed cash, they ask 20% surplus and couldn't return the change. Audio was so loud that it hurt our ears. Planes are old and dirty.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Don't buy tickets from Pegasus","I booked my flight on 1st of April one month ago to escape Russia. It was my chance to leave this place for good. On 18th of March Pegasus cancelled my ticket. NOT THE FLIGHT ITSELF. Guess, they decided to cancel all the cheap tickets they sold to people. Because now for the same flight and class it costs 3 times more.

Disgusting",3,"2022",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","It’s CHEAP - both price and service","Worst Service, delays and communication. Flight delayed by 14 hours at Stansted and we did not see a single Airline employee to assure us or communicate about the delays. Waited at the gate for an hour before there was a public announcement that flight was delayed. Flight itself was VERY basic, they charge you for everything including water.

NEVER FLYING WITH THEM AGAIN!!!
Thank God for Turkish Airlines.",3,"2022",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Very happy with this airline!","I had very low expectations for this airline, but I feel that they are owed some credit. My plane was on its way from Istanbul to Erbil, but due to a dust storm the Erbil Airport was closed and the plane needed to go back to Istanbul. A lot of companies say that you are on your own if something happens due to a weather event, but Pegasus automatically booked everyone on the plane onto the next flight and paid for everyone to stay in hotels and got us free transport to the hotels. I am very grateful and glad that despite the weather conditions, I did not have to sleep at the airport or pay for an expensive hotel room.",3,"2022",5

If you need to get involved with customer service for whatever reason they will never place your concerns first, they only care about money. I had a connecting flight and I just wanted to change one leg of the flight. Customer services changed both flights, and it was only after they took my payment that they mentioned that it was impossible to change just one leg of the flight according to their policies. I asked to change my flight back to the original flight and they charged me extra. In total I payed £152 to end up with the same flight I had to begin with. When I complained they completely dismissed my perspective and denied any wrongdoing. They closed my case immediately and kept my money… disgusting.",2,"2022",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Pegasus denyed my boarding to Greece ilegally even after I proved to them","I had a flight from Istanbul to Athens-Greece on the 17th Feb with Pegasus Airlines and I was denyed taking that flight. They claimed that Greece had a list of allowed countries which Brazil was not part of it. It was actually the correct rule until the 7th Feb, when Greece cancelled the country list and opened borders to all including Brazil. I was connecting flight so I had the entire day at SAW airport so I had time to gather many evidences such as: media publications, Greek official website, other international websites like IATA, other airline's rules etc. I even called the greek embassy itself who confirmed my point.
I explained it all several times to the attendants, supervisor, manager, Pegasus office. None listened, nothing worked. They denyed my check-in to the flight.
The result was: I had to purchase another flight from another company for the next day, had a sleep over in Istanbul and, as expected, could naturally fly to Greece the day after.",2,"2022",1

Worst airline ever, I thought I had seen it all but this airline is the worst company I have ever seen. They don't care at all for you and the customer service is terrible!! This airline should close down. The staff made me miss my flight back home and I had no choice but to buy a new one.

But you get what you pay for! I see why its so cheap. Because the only thing that they did good was take off and land safely

In Alanya there was no ""strong wind"", it was only 9km/h, they didn't provide any transfer from Antalya where they landed us, to Alanya.

We then had to wait for another flight and had already missed our connection flight through Turkey due to this. We then flew to Turkey at 4 pm and in Turkey they did NOT help at all..5 kids lying down on chair in the airport to try to sleep and NO Service was available at the pegasus airline desk as it was empty and no one showed until 3h later with a huge line of angry ppl like myself asking for help with their canceled flights. No one to help assure us when is our replacement flight back to the UK.after crying and shouting in the airport and them seeing 5 small kids lying at 3am in the airport, they issued us a hotel to sleep for 2.5h and at 7 we were back to the airport for our next flight to the UK.

I had paid for a flight, had been fully vaccinated, and had proof of vaccination with QR code.

They refused to let me on the flight because they had no way to scan my QR code on my vaccine passport, while letting people with faked vaccine certificates fly.

Eventually an employee was able to verify my vaccine passport, by having to download an app to their personal phone. Company still would not let me fly, and refused to issue a refund or another flight.

UK let me in, and about 10 other airlines recognized my valid vaccine passport.

The front line staff went above and beyond to help me, but their GROSSLY INCOMPETENT manager hidden away in some office somewhere was too stupid to understand vaccine passports use QR codes.

I have seen that kind of incompetence in middle management destroy many companies.

I can guarantee this airline will not be able to remain in business for long.",2,"2022",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Not impressed","After weeks of intense work, I decided to take a short break to Istanbul. My flight from London to Istanbul was ok, staff were pleasant, flight was good. Return flight was however a nightmare. Called the airline night before to check and was told you dont need anythign just ensure antigen test booked on arrival at home. At the airport 3 hours ahead, like most passengers didnt realise we had to have a PLF for return home (explains why the queue was very slow moving and long - everyone was trying to fill the form at the desk) There is no WifI at the airport, airline desk staff are least helpful, they just send you away. One Pegusus staff supposed to assist
generally said to me ""I dont want to talk right now"". I had to buy breakfast at a Cafe to get wifi, completing the form, ran to counter and found a couple struggling to complete the form, tried to speak to the staff across at the counter and was told ""sorry we are closed, you are late ! "" while it was 50mins prior to flight. I had just the hand luggage, but they weren't bothered. The staff were plain rude and dismissive. I had to change flight and take the next one 5 hours later. Went through same formality again with the front desk staff - not pleasant, just glaze over people. Got down to the gate, had to present all my papers to the attendant and got the same attitude - high pitch volume, glaze over and ""ooff"" if I couldn't present my documents quick enough from the phone for her to see ! I have never experienced this before in the years I've travelled and twice to Istanbul with Turkish airline and Lufthansa. Totally disappointed with the attitude and approach by the staff, not appropriate. I would not recommend return by Pegasus from Turkey at all. Customer service is very important to everyone - in my line of work I would never pull off such behaviour. The experiecne has left a bad memory for me and not really impressed with Pegasus airline at all.",2,"2022",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Very Considerate","I specifically paid for a more space seat and given a snack. Although the plane is old, I was comfortable. The staff at check in and on the plane were very helpful and pleasant.

The staff at this check in was very nice.",2,"2022",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Efficient","Flight check in was efficient and checked covid vaccine status and locator form for Turkey. Flight boarded on time out and return.

No space in front of you to put some small belongings, schedules of flights are the worst (night flights with 5-7 hours transfer in the worst airport in Istanbul).
Cherry on top is people, jumping out of their seat as as soon as plane touches the ground. Cabin crew does nothing with that, so ignorant people just start to take out their bags above your head while plane is still going…",1,"2022",1

One of the worst queues I’ve ever seen , you literally have to be in the airport 3+ hr before the flight or you risk not getting on board.
Staff didn’t know that I speak Turkish and were very rude to each other because of the mixup and where rude to other passengers as well.
Contacted Pegasus a number of times and sent two emails requesting a refund for the seats I booked but got nothing back.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Absolutely horrendous experience !!!!!!!","Flight from Manchester to instanbul airport.

Where do I even begin… we had our documents and passports stolen on the flight when we landed in instanbul and when we told the aircraft attendant (lady with short black hair) she said we had to wait until all passengers had left the plane to check the plane for our stuff. I said to the lady that they needed to stop all passengers leaving the flight and going through the border until we found our important documents and she continued to say that we had to wait until everyone had gotten off the plane.
when I continued to talk she walked off, We were left in an emotional state looking through the plane underneath the seats and in the overhead compartments trying to find our passports and documents. They told us to hurry up because they needed us off the plane - absolutely no concern what so ever !!!!!!!! We got rushed off the plane crying and in a state and then taken to instanbul airport police department where we got accused of coming into there country without a passport!!!! We had all the documents on emails and our flight details that we showed them and proved from our own emails on our phones and they still said it wasn’t even proof!!! They took our phones and hand luggage and locked us in a room overnight with nothing , no water no clothes/toothbrush anything. We asked for cctv footage and was told they have no cctv on planes (absolutely ridiculous! Where is the safety for the passengers here!!!!!!) luckily when I got off the plane I had rung my family and friend and they rung the British embassy, we ended up getting returned to Manchester airport at 10am the next morning. We were treated absolutely horrendous , disregarded , accussed and now completely out of pocket by something that was no fault of our own! We are still in shock and horrified by what has happened.

Avoid them !! never in my life and I use alot of budget airlines have I experienced such bad service a 5 year old could have designed a better website and there staff are just rude only there for the wage and they don't give a shi? .

"Pegasus-Airlines","All of my trips with pegasus are 10/10","Love the service, and my flights has never been any complications at all. I’m super friendly to all of the staff and they also return the favor of beeing friendly.

The staff is 10/10 they are also humans and doing there job perfectly!
The pilots: 10/10 smooth landings, perfect info.
I fly allot back and forth, but what I wish Pegasus had was businesses class, I would take Pegasus over Turkish airlines all the time.

The prices of the tickets are good, the website has gotten better with time and the customer service is also good!

The seats are a little tight but still, you can mange to sit down at a cafe for 3h then you manage to sit at the airplane seats for 3h without complaints!

This is not Pegasus fault, but usually passengers that complaints towards the crew. They want super service for a low cost.. they wish they could fly business but can’t afford so they show diss respect towards the flight crew.
Mostly towards the hostess because they are female and the men in usually mid 35-40s and older with a mentality stuck in 1700s. You know what I mean :)

Something you should learn in life. Be able to compromise and they will compromise, if you know how to adapt they will also adapt! So meany times I have helped to change seats because a family wants to sit together then they move me to the wing or a full empty row, or if I need something they come directly to me, or ask med.

Be nice to others and they will be nice to you!

After all, I will still keep flying with Pegasus because I prefer them over Turkish airlines. And I fly more then average

With best regards

The airline checkin staff was rude and they didn't even guide me properly and they deliberately made it so my ticket gets wasted. I contacted their customer service they initially said you will be compensated but later they neither provided any compensation but later said that I can not use the return flight as well. I would never use their service again.

I can provide my booking number and day and time of flight.",1,"2022",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","The worst","I bought 3 tickets for my family and the night before the flight I just saw they paid back the money to my bank acount and they canceled the flight of my family. I reserved seats in front 3 weeks earlier in a cheap price, I just realized they found to sell more expensive and they canceled without reasôn! And when I called them they just said ok now what we can do??? And I had to buy again from another company in very expensive price as I already paid hotels and... for my family . Even the flight is horrible always . Seats are very small and that’s why I booked front seats",1,"2022",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst airline ever!","Worst airline with the worst service ever. I have never travelled with such a pathetic airline in my life!
We travelled from Manchester to Karachi and had a supposedly 2 hour stopover in the Sabiha Gokcen airport which turned into a 6hour 15 minutes transit with no food or place to rest. They gave us a false excuse that the delay was because of fog in Karachi. I say false excuse because our other family members travelled the next on the same route from Manchester and they were delayed for over 24 hours.
We were already in Karachi when they went through this ordeal and the weather was perfect in Karachi. No fog whatsoever",1,"2022",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Rude staff, no emails regarding travel pcr test.","No email from airline in this regard. When i reached airport i was not allowed to check in even though there was plenty of time to do pcr test but they did not even care for the passenger, pcr test was delayed as a result i wasn’t allowed to board flight. I contacted the helpline they assured me i will be compensated for next ticket. No compensation was given even i wasn’t allowed to use the return ticket.

Not recommended. Very unprofessional and rude.

If you look at other airlines e.g emirates, if your flight is affected due to late pcr they arrange next flight without any charge.",1,"2022",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Terrible customer service","The customer care is hamefully poor. They broke my hard case Benetton baggage. The lady at the airport instead of the documentation about it rtied to give me a poorly made low quality one, but at least I had my report at the end. They told me to register my case at Pegasus's specific site which isn't working. At the end I had my case created on the phone. a couple days after arriving. It's been 73 days, not a thing happened other than them offering me ridiculous amounts (30 EUR, 40 EUR, 50 EUR) for a 300 EUR suitcase. They do not provide me the necessary information about what I need. I had to contact Benetton offices of 3 counrtys an 2 continents for providing me the required documents(which I know becouse I call them every couple days, they don't answer me via email nor call me). They are still using excuses why they can not accept the official documenta from Benetton. Also the English speaking cs assosiates both 2 are just shouting to me and don't let me finish not my sentences nor my questions and than shut the phone. So unprofessional. Such a shame",1,"2022",2

I was at the correct check-in counters one hour before the declared departure time, but they were closed and I couldn't find any Pegasus staff or office to talk to. I asked Turkish Airlines team and some other people about it; they told me that the Pegasus check-in counters already closed - one hour earlier. How is this possible? This is the first time in my life I had such an issue - airplanes leave one hour earlier. I encountered this issue in both Dusseldorf and Istanbul. I don't think Pegasus planes ever flied on that date.",1,"2022",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Avoid even if you have to pay double elsewhere!!","- We were denied to board our flight back to Manchester (without any fault of ours)
- We were not provided any support

- We were tricked and forced to enter a country we did not plan to by Pegasus staff.

- We were not provided next flight, even though there was availability (assume because it was cheaper for Pegasus to book us on 2 days later)

- We were not provided any accommodation

- We were mentally harassed by some of the staff members, some even laughed at me and my family including kids, when we mentioned that we have nowhere to go to.

- We had to book hotel for 2 nights for 5 people on our own cost
- We had to book taxi to and from airport
- We had to re-do all our Covid tests again prior to next flight at extra costs
- We had to pay for 2 days of additional food, money exchange and taxi rides
- We had to go through process of luggage check-ins and long queues putting ourselves at extra risk of COVID (compared to what we expected in original situation)
- We suffered mental harassment from at least 3 members of Pegasus staff at Istanbul airport. They literally laughed at our situation and said ""bad luck"".
- Kids did were scared to go back to same airport due to the horrible experience

we noticed atleast 5 others in same situation and some ended up buying new tickets with other company.",1,"2022",1

So, I went talk to Pegasus Lost and Found office. There was a LF agent guy named Mustafa helped me so much and he was like he lost his own luggage. He really really helped me. It was a very crowded day but he was very friendly and polite to other passengers while he was triying to help me. He could speak English very well. Respect for him. I don't know whether he has a girlfriend or not but oh well :) they sent my luggage to my hotel after a couple of days.

After traveling to destination customer service said that you can not use inbound because your ticket status is no-show.

Not only did refuse to help me, whilst boarding the next flight to Stansted my passport was checked by five different staff on five different occasions.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Alright.. in some ways","Check in literally sucked. Only 4 Check-in counters were open for international flights (there’s like over 20 flights) some passengers were asked to use the set Check-in, which is actually pretty great if you get to know the system. There were no helpers when we started to do the self check in processes though..

Flight itself was actually pretty good, we departed 20 minutes late, but we still arrived in time to Copenhagen.

Inflight meals were greatly priced and tasted pretty good since they were made by Turkish do&co (they also serve Turkish Airlines) other than that, the seat was ok, although your butt can be like a rock after some hours..

The planes are ranging from 1-5 years of age, Pegasus is currently trying to get a full airbus fleet, if you are unlucky, you might come across the 737s that are not that new. Some of them are still in ok condition.

Have a safe flight…",12,"2021",4

"Pegasus-Airlines","Discriminatory boarding policy on the national basis","Very bad overall experience. On the flight from Istanbul (Turkey) to Belgrade (Serbia) the staff at the gate discriminated against passengers, not allowing Serbian citizens to bring aboard one piece of cabin luggage (which we are allowed according to the fare we paid for), while allowing their own, Turkish citizens, to bring along a few items on board. Nobody explained the reason behind this and we were not given any clear instructions. Once aboard, the cabin crew wanted to send down our cabin luggage in order to provide more room for Turkish passengers They were unprofessional, extremely rude and ignorant. Their level of English didn't allow them to win this argument, however. Definitely not flying with them again. To discriminate on a national basis in the 21st century is shameful. Educate your staff about democracy and basic manners!",12,"2021",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst airline ever","I was driven to tears by this airline, disappointed lots of passengers. Vowed never to use them again.

The flight was meant to leave Dubai by 5:15am but unfortunately they left by 6:48, on getting to Istanbul I had to get a new boarding ticket to TRNC, they wasted my time for close to an hour and they were well aware my flight already started checking in. On getting to the gate I wasn’t allowed access was told it was closed. Pegasus never took responsibility for this and made me pay for another ticket to my destination.

Not to talk of the bad customer service really unprofessional, staff use the opportunity of not understanding English to act badly to passengers and ignore us and our complaints. I stood at the customer service counter for close to 3 hours, no one was there to attend to me till later and my flight was long gone.",12,"2021",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Sheer pandemonium at SAW Airport.","Flew with Pegasus from Istanbul SAW to Manchester in November 2020.
I arrived at Istanbul SAW airport to scenes of chaos outside the terminal, as HES codes were scanned before entering, a stressful start which I appreciate is out of the airlines control, but was only a sign of things to come.
Once entering the terminal, I located the check in desk. No queue control or management whatsoever. Although I was checked in pretty quickly by a friendly agent, some form of queue management could be implemented as often people were in the wrong queue checking in for the wrong flight.
After passing through security airside, the real problems began at boarding. Our boarding gate was via buses and we had a gate change too, this was chaotic and shambolic with no management or organisation. It's the worst airport experience I've ever had in years of travelling around the world. People were pushing shoving, getting into very heated arguments with staff and other passengers, all because Pegasus were changing gates last minute, not setting up proper queuing or people management systems and once again checking covid documentation (which had already been checked twice prior to getting to the gate - just in case we decided to change details while in the airport?!?) by pen and paper - its 2021, surely this could've been done electronically?!? I despair.
People were trying to board the wrong flights, one person who should've been flying to London boarded our bus incorrectly, due to the lack of organisation and sheer bedlam at the gate area.
The flight itself was ok - Pegasus are a budget airline with buy on board food and drink and no in-flight entertainment. I had a coffee and a sandwich, the sandwich was good but the coffee was poor. The seat was reasonably comfy for a 4 hour flight, legroom fine and the aircraft was clean. Good marks for aircraft cleanliness, I'll give credit where it's due. Crew however were poor, they really did not care and there was no enforcement of COVID mask wearing so many just went without.
Overall, I wouldn't fly Pegasus again - the airport experience was enough to put me off trying them again despite the flight itself being ok. Top tip would be just to fly Turkish Airlines for a better experience and less hassle, the increased cost is justified having flown with both.",12,"2021",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Bab review","Whilst in boarding, the service and the attitude was very bad and unprofessional. I was checked and my bags were checked numerous times, with a very bad attitude. One of the incidents included that a boarding staff asked me for the QR code and while I was just pulling out the phone and trying to find my QR code which probably in summation only took a couple of seconds, the boarding staff left and said that I am not allowed to enter the airplane and wait until she checks each and every QR code of the people standing with me in the gate. Keep in mind that it was my turn. Lack of patience, lack of morals, lack of professionalism and above all a very rude attitude. Overall the service was very bad, and an experience I'd never would want to face again, so definitely never flying with Pegasus Airlane ever again.",12,"2021",1

I am a pregnant woman, 25 weeks pregnant, after he pushed me in my stomach i felt very painful that I couldn’t stand on my feet and i had sickness. The other staff members ignored us and say they didn’t see that he pushed me. Other passengers witnessed what happened and they came with us to submit a complaint to the police. I have complained to the police but no one from Pegasus tried to help us. It’s a company with violent staff and violent system. They don’t have any respect for the passengers.

After some years of not flying with them , I decided to take up their cheap offer of Istanbul to Tbilisi flight in the hope that they had improved.
Arriving at their main base of Sabiha Gokcen airport / Istanbul , their self check in machine referred me to the counter . This was easier said than done since the airline had many counters there but some either not staffed or some only accepting luggage of self checked in passengers. Only one isle of counter ( 5-6 staff) was available and this caused some 200-250 people to wait their turns. After waiting for 1 hour and 15 minutes finally it was our turn and we were able to check in , but a young girl standing immediately in fron of us wasn't so lucky as all that waiting had caused her check in to Krasnodar to close . The attendant would not show any reaction to her protests about waiting so long but simply saying that she had to buy a new ticket for the next flight.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Price vs quality","Like most low(er) costers, the price definitely reflects the quality. The flight itself was ok, and I would in general say it's comparable to other low coster flights. My two main issues were during check-in and boarding. Check-in wasn't possible online and the check-in staff was incredibly slow, the airline could've easily sent out the forms by email and checked in half the passengers online. Secondly, boarding was not well organized, they also didn't properly account for cabin luggage space by allowing at least half the passengers to bring multiple pieces on board resulting in overcrowded lockers where you couldn't place even a jacket. Besides these two points, the flight was relatively smooth and both on the way there and back even though the plane departed with a delay it arrived at the destination slightly ahead of schedule.",11,"2021",3

"Pegasus-Airlines","Pegasus for the 1st & The Last Time","I made this trip on many occasions and I've enjoyed it thanks to Turkish Airlines, BA etc. But my flight on 6th November was really bad but having read recent reviews, I think I was lucky to say the least...😥

My flight was scheduled for 12.50pm departure but we actually left shortly after 8.30pm. that's over 7 hours and 40 mns delay. The check in staff knew nothing about the delay.

I rang customer service after 1pm and waited, waited, waited for over 45mns and when I finally managed to get through, I tried to get on a flight that was meant to depart @ 16.30 (after mine it actually department before mine). So the member of staff said yes, no problem. I was allowed to change flight and so I made my way back to check in by leaving the security area through the backdoor etc. It took me at least 15 mns and when I finally made it to check in desk to get my boarding pass, I was told that the system couldn't allow him to make the changes anyway. I was shocked and in disbelief that I was dealing with inefficient staff. Yet the check-in desk couldn't do anything because it's not their job to make flight changes.

I made it back through security and waited, waited and waited and finally an announcement was made inviting me to meet at customer service to hear that fog was to blame for our flight delay and yet no one knows how the flight of 4.30pm managed to leave with just half an hour delay. We were handed £10 voucher per person for refreshment. Member of staff lost their cool and couldn't answer a straight forward question. Not impressed.

Yes, their aircraft are old, tired and seriously I wouldn't trust them again with a straight forward single flight let alone a connecting one.

While waiting for my return flight on 12th November, I heard about a group of people who were refused to board when the aircraft was still at the gate and another young woman in tears due to missing her connecting flight thanks to staff shortages and long queues in the transit area.

DEFINITELY NEVER AGAIN",11,"2021",1

"Pegasus-Airlines","Thought I alreasdy knew the worst airlines!!","I need to revisit my list of worst airlines, cos Pegasus would be the worst, and I have flown over 40 airlines in 40 years!
Arriving in transit from Doha, with a transit time of 2 hours, my first surprise was the queue for the single transit desk open, I counted 40 people waiting then stopped counting. Decided to go straight to the check in area, and my second surprise, each row of check-in desks had four lines of passengers waiting to check in, and a third of the desks unmanned, I joined the queue.
After 90 minutes I arrived at a check-in desk, to be told 'sorry, the flight is closed'. I asked in my best English, 'are they crazy, how can they keep me waiting 90 minutes in the line & then close the flight. Just to give you the picture, there were no senior staff or managers around, and the poor harrassed check-in staff were doing their best to help the multitude of disgruntled passengers.
We were sent to the sales windows to rebook a flight, where of course was another queue, and I was given a new flight 10 hours later.
Then surprise number three, having decided to check in as early as was permitted, I arrived at the check-in desk, to be told that I could not check in because my COVID test certificate was now out of time, i.e. more than the permitted 72 hours before the flight. Arguing whose fault that was was useless, fortunately there was a 90 minute COVID test station at the terminal, so I had to get a new certificate, at my expense, in order to finally fly out.

Only the luggage you buy as ""extra"" is the same carry on my ticked allowed me to take in the first place.

I was not told that i needed a Visa for Kuweit. Allthough my Passport was properly checked by the airline staff. Arriving to Istanbul and waiting 4 hours for my connecting flight, i was told that i can not proceed to my connecting fligh. The Turkish staff is really unpolite and they refuse to speak English. I have never seen a folk worse than them. That was my last time coming in this country. They did not compansate anything and ignored me for severl hours.

Next day, flight got diverted to IST without no one being notified beforehad, I only found out when we were landing and I could see the airport was not Sabiha!! Had to do passport control and bagagge pick up in ISt , bus to Sabiha and then check in, pass control, security ALL over again in Sabiha!!

"Pegasus-Airlines","We will call legal actions onto this","First of all our flight from Antalya to Istanbul was delayed 3 hours. Foggy as we all have read it below.

And of course we missed the follow-up flight. So Pegasus assumably booked for the next flight at 14.40.
Now: that plane startet boarding at 16.40 - so toll hours late. Then they refused to take us and another 11 passangers with the same situation. BUT they said 70% of our luggage could go with.

Then we have to arrange a New flight and of course look for our suitcases, as some should've stayed in Istanbul.

After long discussions etc etc. Pegasus wanted to book us for the next flight possible: which would've been on 11th November 2021!!!
We should wait in line for hotel Transfer (and all of you saw that there were at least 200 people in line).

And dear Pegasus: soweit people have to work. We cannot wait 3 days for you to get your stuff together.

We decided to buy tickets at another airline (420€ per person on a crappy plane and to Frankfurt, as Stuttgart was even more expensible).

So after 5 hours in Antalya and 22+ hours in Istanbul we finally boarded a plane to Frankfurt...

In germany we immediately called Stuttgart to find our luggage and guess what: the luggage seems to have disappeared... now we are playing some sick cat and mouse game with Pegasus, as they want us to comtact Turkey about our luggage.

As written above: we will sue. We will give Pegasus the chance to balance the costs (approx. 1100 € atm) which occured because of their complete lack of professionality and organisation.

If our luggage should be gone for good, the amount could at least be doubled.",11,"2021",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Neeeeverrrrrrr again","First of all: Learn your employers Englisch!

We hope that we really have seats in the plane To our wrong destination now and that by some miricle our luggage is following there. But I doubt it.

To everyone who is informing himself here before booking: dont go with pegasus Airlines. Better pay 100€ more and go with a propper airline. It will save you nerves and in the end a lot of money.

To Nearport Hotel: thank you for excellent Service, englisch speaking personal, good food and a cozy bed. I know... you got pur money for that, but so did Pegasus Airlines ... you can be theoretisch role Model.",11,"2021",2

No accommodations at the flights is one of the weakest points, the other day i’ve took 3 hours flight from iran to antalya they didn't even gave water but they took money because of 1kg over weight of my baggage.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Rather challenging experience","To start with, my first flight (of a two-flight journey) was cancelled. I had to take an 8:20 flight from Dalaman to Instambul and then take a connecting flight to Moscow. At 1.40 am I received an sms (in Turkish) that my flight from Dalaman was cancelled. There was a link included to change my ticket but when I clicked on it, the page which opened still showed me that everything was fine and that I was checked-in to flight as scheduled. I decided not to take my chances and called a hotline. Indeed, my flight was cancelled. But luckily, there was another flight just 40 minutes later and they rebooked me for it.
When I arrived at Dalaman airport I saw a huge line to the Pegasus counter, with people desperate to change their tickets and make it for their connecting flight in Instambul. I'm not sure how many people made it in the end (I would expect that this 9 am flight was largely overbooked).
This was not the end of the story. When I arrived in Instambul, I learnt that was connecting flight was delayed by 2 h 45 m. So, it turned out a very stressful and tiresome journey for me.",11,"2021",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","rudeness! Terrible experience","I flied with Pegasus and didn’t expect to be treated like a dirt by one of the worker of the company at the airport. I told him “Hi” then he replied “WHAT?!” Then I asked him “Can you help me, please? He stood, starting at me for few seconds, then said out of a blunt “NO” then he left. I was amazed by this answer, like how, why?
Then I tried to find someone else who did help me, and when I went to Pegasus counter again I saw him, didn’t dare to ask him for help again, but his supervisor was here then I asked the supervisor who did help me. What I want to ask from Pegasus is “are your workers supposed to help their passenger?”
His name is Safa.M

"Pegasus-Airlines","Lost Baggage","My family and I flew back from Antalya via Istanbul to London Stansted airport on 30 October 2021.
3 bags were checked in but only one has surfaced.
For the other two, we waited by the carousel for over an hour and ended up looking for Pegasus help desk to report the missing bags. There was no one at the help desk. It was past midnight and the baggage area deserted.
I went home and the following day started following up by making enquiries online and calling Pegasus Airlines to report the missing bags. After almost 4 hours of phone calls, and talking to rude people, I gave up trying.
However, I managed to complete an online baggage claim form but wasn’t able to get certain codes related to the baggage. I called Pegasus Airlines to ask why they required my bank name and details? No straight answer.
To cut a story short, I just need my bags returned. And,
Pegasus Airlines are not at all interested in helping or advising how to retrieve the missing bags.
If anyone can help, I will appreciate all the help and advise.

Could the reason be that I flew home on a flight that I couldn’t take at the scheduled time because I eventually flew out on the 4th flight due to the locator form saga. The baggge tags carried the flight details of the flight I didn’t get to board!

For now, Turkey and Pegasus are off the menu.",10,"2021",1

For two plane tickets that cost me $1400 I could fly with away better airlines. Even a sip of water they sale it to all the passengers. NOT ACCEPTABLE!!!
Not talking about the rudness of the flight attendants the poor quality and uncomfortable seat. I'm so surprised of how bad the service could be offered inside a plane.",10,"2021",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Never ever try this airline","Their booking system has the issue that the money will be withdrawn from your account without any successful booking, and they don't pay you back. They have the worst hotline and support ever. They close your support query without even answering you. I paid for a ticket twice as there are some issues on their website. With the Money I paid, I could travel with the better airline!

Last year I bought a ticket and I paid extra for my pet, which was also written in my ticket. At the airport, they requested for more money and said that there are no payments for the pet in the system and I had to pay again as I was with my pet at airport and had no other choice.

They never even sent me an email or anything to check in the day before because that's the way they do business, very shady & untruthful, also the lady that spoke to me on the phone had a really bad attitude the whole call, do yourself a favor & pay more & fly with another airline, you'll be glad you did!!",10,"2021",1

"Pegasus-Airlines","New planes, precise schedule, great prices","Contrary to many reviewers here I am very positive about Pegasus airlines.
As a experienced traveler I always take airline reviews with caution, as the majority of travelers after a good experience don't come here to express it as they consider it quite normal. So, mainly you'll find reviews of bad experienced travelers here who express it to relieve themselves. Also, I make around 30 flights a year, so can make a difference between good and bad.
During our 2 weeks Turkey tour we had six flights with Pegasus and all of them were on A320 or A321, which were almost brand new. All flights performed on time.
Cabin was perfectly clean, the staff very kind.
Have in mind Pegasus is a low cost carrier, so do not expect reclining seats or inflight entertainment. Food and beverages can be bought onboard for a reasonable price.
Those expecting higher standards should opt for Turkish airlines, but be prepared to pay significantly higher fares.",10,"2021",5

on it with a pen although i have another 2 luggages with their labels and codes, but the broken one they have removed its code and label to hide their crime.Really itis a dishonest Airlines.My question is why the other 2 luggages have label but those one hasn't!

the staff was rude to us and they didn't even try to see or right our complain, they requested us to call call center where you have to wait for long time and they don't speak English good.

they sorted for us Hotel where the hotel was full and asked us every three will be in one room. and the hotels was in industrial area where you be in a prison till your time come to fly.

they disturbed our plans for two days where we lost much in out business and we couldn't find any care from this nightmare airline.

Having booked direct flights through our tour operator we then had to pay an additional £89 when Pegasus cancelled this flight and offered an indirect flight instead.
We could not check in on line for the second flight from Istanbul to London as they no longer do this service??
When we tried to check in at Antalya for the second flight we were told we had to do this at Istanbul.
Our first flight landed on time at 10:25 and we went to the desk to check in to be informed that the desk closed and we could not get on this flight. This was at 10:50 and the flight doesn’t leave until 11:35.
The Pegasus manager Mehmet Toruń (5093) was quite simply rude and obnoxious and very unwilling to help. So we then had to go to the Pegasus desk to be told we could have the next flight at 21:00hrs.
So we have paid and extra £89 each to be delayed 10hours what a joke. We will never fly with Pegasus again.",10,"2021",1

She was very mean, impolite, unprofessional and unethical. She was talking to me in an unacceptable was, saying unacceptable words and repeatedly told me that she won't let me get on board without paying or she will throw away my baggage. On the website of the airline there is no mention of 100$ for 2 extra kg, they don't answer nor reply.

Seems like me and my travel companion were the only two people who actually followed the airlines’ own darn rule.
Also no rhyme or reason on how they board, no announcement as far as “hey, we are boarding”. They get 1 out of 10 in my book for customer service and communication. This is like the Turkish version of Spirit Airlines in US.",9,"2021",2

The leg room was just adequate for a person 6ft tall as I am. The lavatories were clean though. The check in experience on the ground was ok, nothing bad but nothing extraordinary either. If asked whether I would fly again with Pegasus the answer would be a 100% YES, simply because the prices are VERY cheap, especially if you book in advance. At this price point I believe any enthusiastic traveler would ignore the average service. I do recommend that you do bring some snacks along with you as the inflight food is quite expensive and also your tablet or laptop to keep yourself entertained. And if you could download some movies or Netflix offline to view then your flight will be very pleasant.",9,"2021",3

"Pegasus-Airlines","Incorrect Covid information and poor service onboard","I took two flights PC381 Krasnodar to Istanbul and PC1019 Istanbul to Munich. I encountered the first problem in Krasnodar, where I was not allowed to board the plane without first registering online with the Robert Koch Institute. This was not necessary since printed forms were available on the Munich flight. None of the forms were collected by the cabin staff, nor was I asked to show the form at immigration. Quite simply, Pegasus staff did not know the rules! The second problem concerned the meals. I pre-booked a meal on each flight. On the first flight, I was not served with a meal at all. Yes, I fell asleep, but that is to be expected on a flight leaving at 03:30. They simply ""forgot"" to wake me and serve me with a meal. On the second flight, I did get a main meal, but no drink was included, even though I had ordered both a main meal and a desert plus tea or coffee. The menu I used to pre-book the meal online was clearly not the same menu on offer in the aircraft. Its not a big deal and I wouldnt mind, but instead of accepting my word, the cabin staff were prepared to stand in the aisle for a good 10 minutes arguing about whether I should be given a free drink or not. This is meanness taken to the absolute limit. Do they really think that someone would make up a story in order to get a free cup of tea? In my view, its small-minded and really rather pathetic.",8,"2021",2

"Pegasus-Airlines","Never had to wait longer for service than on this flight","I don't mind that the departure of this flight was delayed because of air traffic, but once I was on the plane and it took off, the awaiting time got worse. Every 10min or so, the seatbelt sign was turned on and off, so it took along time for the cabin crew to reach passengers in need. In one case, the sign was on for what felt like eternity, even though there was no turbulence at that time. Eventually the staff got to the passengers. What I found very disturbing was that one passenger asked for a coke and the crew member answered that there was no original coke left, just coke zero. A few seconds later, she passed our row, holding a few original coke cans in her hands, which obviously confused the passenger next to me who asked for a coke before. So I don't know why the attendant lied about not having any coke left on the plane.
The flight itself was clean, even though we had some turbulence but none can do anything about that. Take off and Landing were really smooth.

So all in all, a flight that should've taken only about 3 hours, felt like the longest flight ever, because of slow working crew members and weird lies..",8,"2021",3

There were any respectful behavior by the crews during the flights .When one of the passengers requested a glass of water ,one the crews said :sorry!you must pay by your credit card !!!
I suggest to this airline that at the beginning of each flight ,collect a 2 euro coin from each passenger for water !!
We had a very bad experience in the Antalya airport during our departure from Antalya.There was a lady that she was a new crew and she couldn’t do check in process .She wasted our time and the other passengers.What a disaster!!When we said to the supervisor of the airport ,she smiled and said :she is a new crew !!

"Pegasus-Airlines","Bad customer care and staff in the airport","Didn't admit me on the flight to Germany because of having a PCR test from Syria, claiming that the German authorities don't accept it. I had to book a new flight for the next day and a hotel on my own cost and when I arrived to Germany, the border police told me they accept my test from Syria. Other people were also able to travel the same day to Germany without a problem, they just didn't fly on Pegasus. My denial on board had NO BASIS but Pegasus refused to take any liability for wasting my time, money and nerves.
Apart from this they always had a very slow check-in process and delays.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Horrible experience for a domestic flight, possibly worst ever","We traveled from Istanbul to Bodrum with Pegasus Airlines. We were a group of 7 (4 adults 3 kids). We were unable to precheck online, because we were not given the option. After checking in morning of flight @ the airport, our seats were all separated to different parts of the plane. Even though we stressed to the check in representative and flight crew members about not having our kids separated from us, we were told there was no other option. My 12 year old daughter who didn’t speak Turkish so well was placed in a seat 10 rows from us. I was told this was due to COVID. This was a horrendous experience, you cannot separate kids from parents and place by strangers which is a higher COVID risk.",7,"2021",1

I made my booking with Pegasus directly, online. All experiences up to this point were optimal with prices at really low fair rates. Unfornately when the pandemic struck all flights were cancelled, including mine and my wifes. I attemtped on several occasions to refund my booking to no affect.

What ooccured is an incredible amount of refund requests that the airline was unable to meet. Imagine hundreds and thousands of blocked bookings requesting refunds. I tackled my experience with Pegasus patiently waiting almost a year but I officially received all my bookings back as refunds. I understand the stress and financial burden to Pegasus and wish them the best regards and luck for the post pandemic recovery efforts.

1. My flight from Sarajevo to Istanbul was canceled without ANY notice, no representative at the airport to talk to so you have to call Turkey and talk with them 15 mins and spend your credit in order to reorganize. Cancellation notice never received. (3/7/21)
2. Another flight was the same day from Sarajevo, 6 hours later - that one was late for more than 30 minutes so I had to run through the airport in Istanbul in order to check in for another flight to Antalya. NO ONE from the Pegasus staff speaks English so they were just throwing me from one to another like a basket ball. (3/7/21)
3. Flight from Antalya back to Istanbul - late! No notice, people waiting in line 45 mins, I ask them when the freaking boarding will start and the answer is “Ohhh, the plane didn't land yet” (9/7/21)

"Pegasus-Airlines","WORST FLIGHT OF LIFE","Where do I even start with this airline. Everything about it was miserable. And I mean EVERYTHING. For starters, no one welcomed us on the plane or off for that matter. Second, when sitting down, your knees hit the seat in front of you. And I’m 5’ 5”. There are no pockets in the seat in front and the tray table is tiny, doesn’t even pull out, so are the overhead bins. I saw trash all around me and gum on several seats so the plane was clearly not cleaned. Or at least not well. On a 5 hour flight we got no drinks or food. Everything costs money. Even a small water bottle. It was ridiculous. And when asking to use the restroom the flight attendants made us wait until they were done eating in the front. What? The flight attendants never even walked down the aisles or anything. Not to mention how they charge you for entertainment. The safety instructions were non existent, so as the overhead bin check. And when taking off and landing…no announcements. Occasionally the mic would turn on to make loud noises. No actual talking though. Bumpy and sketchy landing and takeoff. The landing took one hour because the pilot got lost and mistook islands for city. He went up and down and up and down. Real promising. The one interaction with the flight attendants was short and rude. The seats were disgusting and stained. If I could give it a 0 I would. Oh and make sure to have a charged up phone even though there is no entertainment because no power outlets. The seats are not only small but not comfy either. Back is in so much pain. Not cushiony yet hard. Moist towelettes were handed out to 1/2 of the people and they were dry! Worst flight of my life. (Not to mention no reclining seats) Second flight equally as bad but they lost our luggage, and immediately sent us out. Not to mention the flies on the plane.",7,"2021",1

"Pegasus-Airlines","First time traveler with Peguases","i had a connecting flight with pegasus today, the first flight from istanbul to antalya was delayed after the gate was changed three times without a clear announcement. I asked the cabin crew about my second connecting flight and the answer was don't worry we know. Unfortunately, when I arrived in Antalya and the plane was still there, I found that the Pegasus staff tried to push me back with zero assistance. Given their rudeness in communication I tried to understand the situation and that delays are an uncertainty and difficult to control.So I went to the Peguases desk on arrival in Antalya and asked them what are my options now after missing your flight to your delay.The options were more to make your life more difficult and blame you for choosing Peguases. I understand it's a cheap airline but that doesn't mean they shouldn't deliver customer satisfaction. I didn't expect much from them other than to let me arrive safely, but things started to be disrespectful like they can make you wait 3 hours for a taxi to pick you up. What can you expect from an airline that is unable to book a taxi! Being a budget flight doesn't mean they only target a low segment of people. When someone books a ticket, it's mainly a non-compensatory decision because travelers value things differently and not just because of the low price, so I don't understand what right they have to treat travelers in this ugly, unprofessional way. While waiting at the counter for 5 hours and listening to other people's problems, I found out that the staff has no KPI to satisfy the customers, they don't even care about you. In summary, I can only recommend travelers not to use this flight unless Peguases decided to improve their operations and take care of their customers. They are so happy to say we are cheap but still it is known to be a comparison between price VS value even if your price is down ur value is down and down. Many travelers will say I wish I had paid more and not go through this experience because you will end up paying more.",7,"2021",1

"Pegasus-Airlines","Bad trip","A sad story with Pegasus

Today 20/6 is the date of our transit trip to Beirut via Antalya
We are Syrian citizens with a residence permit in Germany, a PCR test and an online ticket
We are surprised by a poor employee from Pegasus who gives us flimsy reasons not to allow us to travel, all of which are untrue ...

First, she demands that we have a stamp for Turkey, which we crossed in transit

Secondly, she said not to allow us to transit through Antalya except with a visa, which was denied by the Turkish Embassy in Berlin and the Pegasus office in Berlin through our contact with them

Thirdly, she asked us for an online residence form in Turkey, and we are not required to fill it in, but we tried to fill it out, and it contains the icon for our residence in Turkey, Antalya, which will not happen.

Finally, we are very angry for wasting our time with a bad and uncooperative employee ... and we will assign a law firm specializing in aviation cases in Germany to delay us and not catch the flight and cause serious harm to us and compensate us in proportion to the extent of the damage

"Pegasus-Airlines","Grossly Incompetent When Handling Battery-Powered Wheelchairs","For travelers NOT carrying electric wheelchairs, Pegasus should be a reasonable airline for you when flying in and around Turkey. However, since I need to transport my 180-kilo (400-pound) chair with me on most of my flights, I have some extra expectations I need satisfied. During my two flights with Pegasus between the new Istanbul airport to Izmir, I realized that these expectations were barely met, and they required intense waiting, negotiating, and persuading. Staff clearly do not know how to handle folks like me in my situation. I know not many Turkish nationals have the support or confidence to travel by themselves if they use their own wheelchair (as do people in lots of other countries with disability stigma), but airlines must know their procedures and be able to streamline things better.

Before I describe my experience in depth, let me give you a quick overview of my wheelchair (my legs). It’s a 400-pound Permobil F3 corpus, containing a permanently-fixed battery of some random voltage that can’t ever be removed (at least without a technician’s help). A permanently-fixed panel swings in and out that contains a joystick, screen showing time and speed in mph, and other various wiring. A permanently-fixed seat and backrest makes up the frame of the chair. Did you notice which word I used three times in this paragraph? Aha! “Permanently-fixed.”

So I found it unacceptable that I had to explain to airline staff over a dozen times that “the battery cannot be removed” and “nothing can be taken off of the chair.” Those phrases are what “permanently-fixed” means. Despite a slight language barrier (but they all spoke fine English), they were insistant that I could just hand them the battery and put it in a bag for the entire flight.

Moreover, once staff finally figured out what I was insisting needed to happen, they couldn’t get enough of how much the voltage was for the battery. Clearly, in both North AND South America, voltage does not matter when airlines transport mobility equipment. But throughout Europe and Asia, I’ve had the hardest time. Upon flying Pegasus, I just didn’t know the voltage, and never thought I’d need this piece of information. Like with all other airlines, I stated the weight, the type (dry cell/non-lithium), and all the other possible facts anyone would remotely require for safety or logistics purposes. But the voltage? Why? It’s non-lithium, so it won’t catch fire. They know the weight. They know it’s unable to be removed. Why?! It is extremely frustrating, especially when figuring it out (and pushing them to just guess the voltage and place a guess into their system) wastes an HOUR of my time.

The big thing: REGARDLESS of voltage or weight, I’m ultimately flying on Pegasus and not any other carrier. I’m not going to be denied boarding or discriminated against. If I was to be discriminated, I’d have filed the appropriate legal action, of course. So even though the staff were obsessed with finding the battery voltage and knowing for sure how to handle the equipment, what difference does it REALLY make? I’m going to be flying regardless. I found it genuinely shocking that over an hour of my time that I could’ve spent at a cafe or watching airplanes was instead allocated to waiting for “supervisor approval” and arguing what I’ve seamlessly gone through in America hundreds of times before. While any other passenger could’ve just strolled right through without delay.

Fortunately, though, I did board the plane, and they did load my chair. I wasn’t denied or discriminated, only inconvenienced to a considerable degree. And I suppose what matters at the end is the state of my equipment: when I received my chair at my arrival airport, nothing was damaged. But my enjoyment of the avgeek and general travel experience was damaged. I IMPLORE Pegasus to do the following:

- Overhaul their company procedures to make it easier when the voltage or weight of a wheelchair is not immediately known.

- **Train their staff** to teach them how to handle these situations, no matter how seldom they may occur in Turkey.

- Understand the significance of traveling with a personal wheelchair, and take consolation measures to make up for inconveniences caused by delays and mismanagement of mobility equipment policies (*not just* when equipment is physically* damaged).

So let’s conclude:

- Able-bodied folks, travel with Pegasus and enjoy a typical ultra low-cost carrier experience with low fares, paid food/drink, paid entertainment, and paid baggage.

- Battery-powered-wheelchair-bound folks, **avoid Pegasus**. There are smoother options out there for you until Pegasus makes improvements.",6,"2021",2

I had to change one ticket, and had to call their support to do this. They were very easygoing and just told me I need to pay the difference between flights, which was fine, I paid it.
Little did I know, and of course no one informed me, that once you change the ticket, the ticket drops to the absolute basic option with no additional services (in-flight entertainment, seat selection, etc.). So, I paid more than double the price of what it would cost me to just cancel the ticket and buy it again than to do that. They made it sound like it's no problem to change it and your ticket is fine.
Then, the flight had no in-flight entertainment, the extra leg-room is just hilarious and there was not even a glass of water for free on-board. You have to pay for everything!!!

Worse, my computer was stuck in the cabin luggage and there was a crash! It didn't end with that either, I paid 154 GBP for another bag due to the same cabin baggage restriction and they took the money from my card 3 times.

"Pegasus-Airlines","They waste your time until you have no time and miss your flight","These people are crazy they make up problems until you lose your flight I think this is an inside job to profit off of customers no respect for anybody only say they can't help or find a solution once you miss your flight and no refund either even though the problem is on their end I am disgusted nobody should ever use this company",4,"2021",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Do NOT book this airline !!!!!","The WORST customer service i’ve ever gotten. I am traveling with a pet from turkey to egypt and it clearly says on their website that she doesn’t need a pet passport unless going to the EU, but when i arrived they say i cant go on the flight because i don’t have a pet passport. They even admitted it looks wrong and won’t give me a refund.

They came up with excuses that didn’t make sense just so they can get away with robbing your money.

There was a crowd of people who they did not let fly/overcharged and they blame the customer and say I cannot help you. I cannot believe this company is still in business, but it definitely won’t be soon. If I could give negative stars I would. Once again I cannot believe just HOW rude and aggressive each and every employee was.",4,"2021",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Horrible !!!","The worst airline I have ever travelled in. I am a very frequent traveller and have flown many different airlines even the budget ones. Recently used Pegasus from SAW Istanbul to Manchester due to a family emergency. Never again.

Arrived at the airport 4 hrs as recommended. Flight was at 1030. I was at the airport 0625 on the dot. A bit of a queue at the entry to the airport. Absolute chaos on the check-in counters. No social distancing, even staff were on top of each other & the passengers. Waited 3.5hrs in queue to check in only to be told the flight is closed. I had been telling the staff over & over again that my flight leaves in 2.5 hrs, then 2 hrs, then 1 hr & was repeatedly told to wait. Once the flight closed, the staff were very rude. One of them said, ""it's not my problem"" . I was travelling with 2 young children. Absolutely horrible customer service & staff attitude.

Rebooked the flight, again the staff member at the ticket counter was very rude & unhelpful. Paid additional £160 for rebooking 3 days later on the next available flight.

On next rebooked flight arrived 5hrs before flight. It was still chaotic at the check in, but managed to get the check in done. But chaos again at the boarding gate. NO social distancing. It was like a cattle market. All the cattle (passengers) being herded on the the bus to the airplane. Saw another ground staff member being very rude & shouting at another passenger. Absolutely disgraceful attitude of the staff. Terrible airline.

I would NEVER fly this airline if I got free tickets. Not even worth that.",3,"2021",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","BE WARE! They will try to rob you every chance they get","I just booked my ticket on Pegasus. Due to available options of changing ticket to Open-ended ticket, I availed it fearing the cancelation of flights due to COVID-19.

Somehow, without showing any details or options, my flight from Berlin to Istanbul was got cancelled in the process of this change. and hence the frustrating race started.

I called the helpline and told them that due to online changes in the status of ticket, I have lost the first flight. After half an hour of discussion, they told me nothing can be done and I have to pay 60.72 Euro more to regain my previous flight.

Considering it might have been my stupidity, I paid that price and tried to change the flight again. BUT NO, they charged me the extra amount, deducted from bank, but did not change the flights. I called them again and tried to clarify the whole situation, they kept repeating, ""We cant do anything"". This kept on increasing my frustration level with them each passing moment.

I called the bank to cancel the payment, the Bank said that the receiving end has to cancel it. Meaning Pegasus will cancel the payment and I will have to wait 8 days for the money to come back. MORE FRUSTRATION!

In short, I paid 60.72 Euro once again to make the necessary changes. A ticket that would have cost me 164 at the end ended up being 285 Euro. I could have spent that money on Turkish, Emirates, Qatar or any other airline and got much more facilities as well. STUPID Me.

Well, though this might give heads up some. Be careful, the budget airlines do not let go any opportunity to ROB the customers of any penny they can lay their hands on.",3,"2021",1

"Pegasus-Airlines","Make Ryan Air look like the Gold Standard of flying","What an utterly disgraceful and shockingly rude airline with equally appalling and rude staff.

I travel a LOT. Predominately for work so I have had the fortune and misfortune to fly airlines all over the world.

But Pegasus Airline are without any shadow of a doubt the rudest bunch of people I have ever come across.

We travelled as a family having gone via Turkey from Dubai.

Our journey started in Dalaman connecting through Istanbul to London Stansted on March 27th.

At checkin in Dalaman we had a very helpful guy who sorted everything out. We said we would like to be seated together as we had young children and this was the case for the first leg. He informed us we would be in a 3 and a 1 for the second leg. I didn’t realise he had given us one boarding pass for both flights so only noticed later that our seats for the second leg were in a 2 and a 1 and a 1.

We got to Istanbul and when we got to the departure gate spoke to a lady and explained the situation. She told us to speak to the person at the final ticket check before we boarded and they would sort it out.

We were at the front of the queue so when boarding commenced we spoke to a lady called Magdalena. I can only assume she had been trained to be super aggressive and as rude as possible to any customer - basically go on full out attack to pre-empt customer complaints. She was unbelievable!

She immediately started shouting at us saying it wasn’t her fault and there was nothing she could do. We hadn’t actually accused her of anything. Just asked her if she could help us as we couldn’t be separated from our 6 and 9 year old girls. Even explaining the situation in a calm way seemed to work her into even more of a blind fury. It was actually quite bizarre. And her behaviour was completely unwarranted.

I asked for her details and she kept shouting her name at us but wouldn’t let me take a photo of her id. When I asked for a manger I was told there wasn’t one. She was bordering on being completely unhinged!

And all of this in front of the entire queue waiting to board the plane.

We cut out losses and boarded the plane.

As we boarded we spoke to a stewardess who happened to be the head stewardess. She said she would help but to take our seats for now and when the person whose seat we would like to swap for turned up she would speak to them.

Whilst we waited an older lady asked me if I would swap seats with her as she wanted to sit next to her elderly husband as Pegasus had also separated them. I agreed as it moved me back to the row in front of my family, instead of across the other side and a row back.

When the Turkish gentleman who had the seat next to our two children arrived we asked if we could swap and he refused. The “helpful” stewardess suddenly complete changed her tune and refused to help. Told us the man had his seat and had to sit in it!!

But because I now had an aisle seat he was happy to swap with me. Meaning that finally at least my wife could sit with our children.

We now had three “happy” customers but this seemed to enflame the situation further because the head stewardess completely objected to this new situation and started having a full blown argument with the man. I couldn’t understand as it was in Turkish but it was clear she hugely objected to her customers now being half way happy.

The flight was a complete mess with the head stewardess generally being grumpy with most passengers and spending the rest of the flight talking to her friend who was sitting in the front row aisle seat.

The queuing for the toilet system they used was a farce as they continually told people to go back to their seats and wait until the toilet was free. This regularly resulted in other people then jumping the queue which caused more upsets and arguments.

The head stewardess wouldn’t let’s us take our children to the toilet. She kept saying they had to go by themselves. Finally to the point where neither of our children wanted to go to the toilet because of the behaviour of this lady.

With just over an hour of the flight remaining we had a tiny bit of turbulence (and I mean as little turbulence as you can get on a flight and call it turbulence). Seatbelt signs on and nobody allowed to use the toilet. A number of elderly people who were obviously desperate to use the toilet kept going up and were turned away again and again by the head stewardess who either glowered at them wagging her fingers or just shouted for them to go back to their seats.

Finally the seat belt signs were turned off and people went to use the bathroom. But the curtain had now been closed with a trolley blocking the way whilst the cabin crew used the toilets. One more bump of turbulence and the seat belt signs went back on and everyone had to sit down again. It was a complete joke.

So the morale of this story is simple. Do NOT ever fly with Pegasus. If there are no other available flight options, get a bus, or boat, or simply walk. They are a disgrace to the airline community.

Flying is stressful and more so at the moment due to the current situation and all the rules which are in place. But there is a way for airlines to deal with it and a way not to deal with it. Pegasus are the best case study in the world in how not to deal with it and how to not treat your customers.

Safe to say we will never ever fly with these jokers again....",3,"2021",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Horrible staff and inconsiderate management","My family and I reached the airport 3 hours early from turkey to pakistan and the attendant took more then 1.5 hours to simply check us in. We are family of 8 including kids and the management just stood there and watched as we stood for check in. The immigration papers for pakistan they had us fill out were not even needed until after we landed in pakistan. The attdendant was not trained and not fluent in english to understand us. Not only did she make a mistake and charged us in our baggage but the managers SUPPORTED her mistake and gave us HORRIBLE service. The flight did not even have complimentary water and the cc machines were not working for us to purchase any drinks. In my years of traveling never have I seen such a horrible airline. I had a great vacation in turkey that was ruined by my outgoing flight with Pegasus. I will never fly Pegasus again. Horrible service, horrible management , horrible flight.",3,"2021",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Liars and totally unreliable","The worst airline in the world. Ince ai bought 3 tickets for my fammily and i reserved 3 seats infront and they issued tickets . And a night before flight i checked , i realized the worst airline paid back my money in my bankacount and there were no tickets without any advanced informing! And as i reserved all things as hotels for my family. i had to buy ticket just at that moment from another airline and in the last minute very expensive. And when i called tgem a day after they just told me what we can do now?!

"Pegasus-Airlines","Rude staff in some airports, slow client service/support, no answear from call center","The staff from check-in desk in Bucharest airport was really rude. We did made a mistake regarding the hand luggages and she was rude and she did disinformed us. She told us that we shall pay 2 cabin luggages. Actually we moved some luggages from one bag to keep it as hand luggage and pay only one cabin bag (40 euros less - for the company obviously).

I tried to pre-order meal for the flight with BOL BOL points. At the end of the process, after I completed the SMS code, the application displays a message. That we cannot buy online meals with bol bol points and we should contact call center. The main problem with call center when you are in another country with minutes only for that country is that they don't speak english. The online (whatsapp) chat is provided only in turkish.
I have sent an email and the answear was that I cannot order meal on the phone via call center I should do it using the mobile app. Say whaaat? I've just explained that the message from the mobile app said I cannot do this online.

One day before the return flight their site and mobile app was down. Obviously we couldn't contact them through the phone because they did not answear at all.",3,"2021",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Horrible and inhumane treatment of the most vulnerable passengers","Very greedy airline that teaches his staff to shake money from passengers in every possible way. Absolutely not customerfriendly. I was horrified by the humalition a passenger had to go through because of extra luggage. Other passengers were not allowed to help either. To divide and rule passengers is what they do. I can not understand how turkish staff can accept to work for such a greedy company, with so unfriendly rule.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Not recommended at all","Worst airline ever, I paid for extra baggage and on the way back the check in service told me that they will charge me extra because they wont count the sum weight of my two baggage which is by the way less than the extra that i paid for. I even called their customer service before my flight and asked them if they will calculate both baggage together and they said YES
on the check in they wanted me to pay extra and said a new rule was made one day before my flight date. I was never informed of the rule by email or message or any way.

No compensation was given from the airlines side!!! They did not even offer to help you, because they basically don’t care about you.

When I got out from the plane, a crew member asked me to show her again all my documents so she can confirm that my luggage can be transferred to the flight which is going to Amman. She checked all my documents again and also everything was OK. I was in the transit about 8 hours, and when I went to board on the second flight which is from Ankara to Amman. while boarding the Pegasus stopped me and told me that i cannot board because I don't have a travel insurance to Jordan.
*Jordan does not require a travel insurance if you are staying less than 30 days (Jordanian Law)
*Jordan requires only two things which are:1. PCR test from the departure country (Ukraine) 2. PCR (QR code) on arrival in the airport

"Pegasus-Airlines","My worst airlines experience","This has to be by far my worst airline experience. Received an email regarding my flight being cancelled - no explanation what so ever why it has been cancelled, what can be done to change it (if possible), not to mention a refund.

So at first I tought ""well there must be a reason, but still very unprofessional, let me check the website"".

The options for the flight are limited and they ask you to pay extra to change the flight, which is absurd when they've cancelled my ticket! Tried calling 3 different phone numbers, two of which do not seem to work or say ""try again later"" every single time. The last phone number 00 90 850 250 6777 leads to nowhere. I must have called 20 times and I don't even want to imagine my phone bill. I've worked in call centers and I have seen people do this. Basically you wait on the line to get connected and you hear the melody in the background, then you get connected, but the agent has their mics muted, so on your end there is no signal. Then you either give up or they disconnect you. This has been ongoing for two days!

So, yesterday I wrote a ticket, and received a replay today. I did explain to them that I can't get through on the phone line, even though their website states that the service is 24/7. Also asked for a reason for the cancellation and how we can proceed. Today I received a reply and my ticket was closed. The reply stated - please use our call center option.

Today I had enough after numerous attempts to get through. I tried raising a refund ticket, and surprise surprise (actually no surprise), the refund option doesn't work. I filled everything accordingly and kept receiving a message, that my request is invalid.

This issue could have been solved within 5 minutes, if someone picked up the phone. Just a simple ""oh no problem, this and that are the reasons why the flight was cancelled, would you like to change it with another one or have a refund?"" and just like that I could have saved my time to deal with this issue or having to write a review which people may or may not read. I WOULD NEVER EVER AGAIN USE THIS COMPANY AND I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE. If you are wise, unlike me, you would be checking reviews before buying a ticket.",12,"2020",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Asked for another (never mentioned before) document at gate and denied boarding","I was trying to fly Istanbul to Frankfurt and was asked to present a COVID PCR test certificate at the gate.
I was denied boarding because I don't have one
At no point before the flight was I made aware that the test is required.

Before the flight I checked Germany's COVID-related entry requirements and PCR tests are explicitly _not_ required by Germany.
Pegasus also sent me a ""get ready for the flight"" email with everything I need to know about luggage size, but _no_ mention of PCR test certificates.
I checked in online and read all the rules on the check in page - no mention of PCR test.
I arrived at the ariport and checked my bag and printed the boarding pass using a check-in machine - it didn't ask me for or warn me about the PCR test (there is a testing location at the airport, so If they warned me at that stage, I could have done it!).
I went through passport control - all good, no mention of the PCR test.

So not only do they deny you boarding for not having a document that isn't required by law anyway, they neglect to inform you they want that document until you're already at the gate!

And it looks like they're not going to refund the ticket, not to mention the costs I incurred because I couldn't get home from Istanbul as planned. I will update the review if they do.",12,"2020",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Terrible Customer Service","I bought 2 tickets on Pegasus airlines to Istanbul with the special offer: Free changes! This meant that I could change my travels dates without paying the change fee, which was a great deal due to the current global pandemic.

However, when I wanted to change my flight the mobile app and web app were both down. I called customer service and was told the system was being restarted and I could only make changes over the phone or wait. Since my flight was that day, and I needed to change it ASAP since Turkey had just announced they would be introducing restrictions and new measures that day. Obviously, I wasn't about to travel and needed to change my ticket.

So I asked the customer service representative whether I could change my ticket free of charge over the phone since I HAD NO OTHER OPTION (of no fault of my own). She said she would have to charge me the change fee and I could then ask for a refund which I would get since it wasn't my fault.

After sending in 2 complaints and multiple emails, Pegasus airlines still refuses to refund the fee. Not to mention all the money I spent on the customer service call even though THEIR SYSTEM WAS DOWN. Proof in the picture.

I used to fly with pegasus often since they were a good budget option. However, I am a woman of principle. I would much rather pay more to fly with Turkish Airlines from now on for example, as long as my business is respected and appreciated.",12,"2020",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","The bad joke of the turkish airlines pegasus and thugness.","Hallo
I have traveled to many destinations with many airline companies around the world,and after flying with pegasus airlines,I think it is the worst flying experience by far due to the terrible way of dealing with the passengers. After a flight cancellation occurred in the (saw)sabiha airport where I was taking a transite. I asked very Respectfully to talk to the manager to understand what was going on. And after 15 minutes the manager came and told me to wait,and then suddenly a person who looked like a soldier with a huge body-look came to me and started to speak in turkish with me trying to intimidate me for no reason by pointing out at me and shouting, after I have told him to speak in English, i understood that he was threatening me and trying to make a humiliation just to prevent me from taking my rights by taking an alternative flight due to the pegasus policy which I did get at the end. At that moment I was shocked, I was threatened by an airlines worker in a place where I do not speak the language and the one who brought this person was the management of the airlines it self. At that moment I wanted just to leave that thug-like person. After I have left that person to talk to some one else he tried to bully me, I just laughed and continued and I found another pegasus counter to explain to them the situation so they could help me but instead of that they started to make fun of me in Turkish, THESE WERE PEGASUS WORKERS who there job is to help passengers during the very stressful situation. That was nothing but racism and arbetry. Something you don't see everywhere.and beside that I got hundreds of dollars as extra expenses. Because I needed to buy a turkish sim so I can contact the pegasus customer service to solve the issue over the phone, and I stayed in istanbul for another 2 nights because the flight was canceled twice, also I have paid for the transportation from and into the airport. I think it is worth it for all of us to travel only with the airlines that respect us as human beings.

Thank you",12,"2020",1

"Pegasus-Airlines","Awful airline","Do not fly a pegasus, at least in Turkey.

Booked Izmir - Istanbul flight 10 days before departure. I wrote my phone number and email in the contact information. We arrived with my wife and one-year-old child early in the morning at the airport and find out that our flight was canceled without notifying the passengers.",12,"2020",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Never again","I flew with pegasus two days ago, from Hurghada to Geneva via Istanbul.
But it was t first and the Last Time în my life.
Turkish company with old fleet, service on board only CASH, and their personal... Well, they should Train them better.
On my first flight, the steward took my card when i need ed to pay and he said my name loud, which îs not profesional. Not at all.
Second flight was even worse, some strânge things happened, so this îs why i ll never fly again with this company.
Advice:avoid, at all costs.
Still, two good things, the spa în their Airport, a nice place where with only 7 euro per night you can ""decompress"", to say so, and they don t charge extra for your second luggages, and, șince i was in Egypt, i came back home with a lot of presents, that mean the world to me... But more about this soon,now i need rest, it was a long flight.
At the end i ll post a song, as I usually do, Xavier Naidoo-was wir alleine nicht schaffen.",12,"2020",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","WORST ATTITUDE","** Don't travel with pegasus - bad service, bad attitude and patriarchal masculinity company **
Apparently, pegasus airlines trying to earn as much money from their clients in a very un-legitimate ways by humiliating their clients so they can resist the pandemic epoch.
I booked my flight from bruxelles to Istanbul, added one 20kg luggage + 8kg suitcase. Yesterday while packing i added 5kg extra, knowing that I've 5 kg extra weight.
I arrived to the check-in desk, there was a lady, we found out that my luggage is 28kg although in home it was 3 kilos less, anyways, that means I've 3 more kilos. She did not say anything. And asked me to lay my 8kg suitcase, it was 10kg instead of 8kg.
She said its 2kg extra so they may let me pay for it in the boarding, I didn't discuss it because I know very well that pegasus always intend to do their maximum to let passengers pay for 1 extra gram. So I moved some stuff to my backpack because it was almost empty.
---------------
At the boarding, suddenly , the scenario changed.
They checked the weight of my suitcase, it was arround 8.8kg. 800grams extra. Two women were standing there, they made a call and a very antipathique macho man appeared to give us his confirmation because he is the man. He came he was so aggressive to me and said that I've to pay 70euros because I have 4kg extra. I refused and explained the fact that I've 800 grams only, but then he explained that I've 3 extra kilos in the check-in luggage that I totally forgot about because it checked in without asking me for extra payment in the check-in desk which is normally happens with normal airlines.
I told him I cannot pay this ammount for less than 1 kilo and that the woman in the check in desk had to inform me in advance that I've to pay for the 3 extra kilos that she ""permets"" with a smile, and in case she did so, then I had the opportunity to remove weight from the luggage! I asked him to bring me the luggage and I'll remove those ""70euros"" 3kilos. He started yelling at me and became very defensive and ""strong shouting man"", told me that they can't bring the luggage its too late, and I have to pay.
I tried to discuss with him that I don't want to pay and that they don't have the right to do so, they passed my check-in luggage without mentioning the fact that I'll pay for the 3 extra kilos, and this is totally unacceptable that they ask for 70euros just in the boarding. That never ever happened that an airlines company asks for extra money for the checkin luggage in the boarding (!!!!!) this is pure exploitation! WHILE I was trying to explain him the situation that they should told me in the checkin desk where I had the capability to get over 3 or 4 kilos and solve the problem without paying 70EUROS, - He was just yelling and interventing my words without listening and without letting me finish my sentences. He told me to pay or leave. I asked him to respect me as I am a client. He was mentioning and waving in his hand and telling me ""how you're going to pay? Cash or visa? Decide now, I want to close the flight door"". letterly.
I paid because I did not have any other choice. it was too late to remove stuff because they meant to put me in that situation, knowing that I can't remove anything from the 25kg luggage that they already took, then they can easily oblige me to pay at last minute before the flight takes off.
What makes them simply THE WORST SERVICE during this stressful pandémie time with two layers of masks, is the fact that I was stressed and I cried and he was rudely tilling me ""No need to cry, that won't change anything, you still have to pay in all cases and we don't have time. so till me how you want to pay?""
He claimed that I have 3 bags as written in the invoice. Although I just had backpack for my laptop which is included in the basic price), the suitcase (that I paid extra for) and my camera which I put in a leather bag.
Honestly I will not be surprised if they will make an entrance to use the toilet 😃
(in December 2019, I traveled with pegasus airlines from Istanbul to izmir, with my two sisters and 3 kids 3-5.y.o, they made it clear in the desk that we had to pay for extra 1.5 kilos , so we did. but their service and attitude was so bad, they didn't smile, and they didn't respect the idea that we are 3 women with 3 kids, they were very slow and whining. In addition they lost one of the kids stroller).",12,"2020",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","VERY VERY VERY .... BAD, SHAMEFULLY BAD","VERY VERY VERY .... BAD, SHAMEFULLY BAD EXPERIENCE! NEVER SEEN SUCH INCOMPETENT STAFF AND SERVICE!
HIGHLIGHTS OF THEIR INCOMPETENCIES AND LACK OF PROFESSIONALISM:
1) Their co-worker didn’t know the difference between a small and a big dog, nor transporting in cabin or in cargo. We had paid the ticket of our tiny dog for cabin, she refused to accept our dog. We had to escalate to supervisor.
2) the co-worker wanted us to take out of checked luggages the extra weight if we didn’t pay for it and carry in our backpacks. We are talking about 1-2 kg and at the end of the day, it is carried in the same aircraft one way or the other. And they do not care during Coronavirus pandemic that there are flying extra weight in additional bags carried by passengers in the cabin. It is safer to have all in one enclosed carry on that should go to cargo section. There are humans dying of hunger on the planet, Pegasus is worried about the financials of 1-2 kg of extra luggage.
3) while we were trying to redistribute the weight on the carousel, the coworker was moving it back and forth. That could have made us loose balance and fall, such an accident could have cost them more than the extra luggage fee of 1-2 kg, I can guarantee that!

"Pegasus-Airlines","Fraudulent company","Me and my wife booked tickets to go to Erbil but pegasus themselves cancelled 2/4 of the total flights (including return). We then had to cancel the remaining two flights because there’s no way to get to our destination with the flights pegasus left us with. We called them and they said that it was us who cancelled it (even though we sent them proof from an email sent by them which clearly highlighted they cancelled the flights). They stubbornly stuck with their initial response. They decided to refund us £200 of the £664 we paid for tickets. I wouldn’t recommend this airline to anyone even if you’re on a budget. Stick with more reliable airlines.",11,"2020",1

There was not another flight to Madrid and for some reason a refund was not possible. The manager told me if I wanted my money back I needed to go to the police. Are you kidding me??

Seat pitch is narrow, but heck you pay lowfare. I had the seat free next to me on the first leg, so that came handy. The crew was nice and pro-active. I didn't buy any food or drink on the plane. Instead, I had a nice meal in the Big Chef restaurant at the Airport in Istanbul. I booked through their webpage, easy and quick. You pay for the services you chose, as expected for a low cost carrier. All flights I took where on time, and passenger & crew where wearing face masks all the time.

Flight was on time to Dalaman, staff were very professional and friendly. Unfortunately our return flight was cancelled so we had to return with Easijet which was dreadful. Nobody wearing masks, long queues for the toilets and both our suitcases broken. We got a refund from Peg9within 48 hours. Already booked with them for next year",11,"2020",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Unprofessional","I flew with Pegasus Airlines for the first time recently. My trip was from Hurghada to Bodrum via a connecting flight at Istanbul. The departure was almost on time, so no complaints there. At the airport though, the staff who were Egyptian are far from professional and courteous. Firstly at the airport, the security wouldn’t even let me enter the terminal. I showed him my passport and email confirmation. Because I didn’t have a printed out letter, he didn’t believe me. After much discussion, another security officer took my passport and went to get confirmation. I was then allowed to enter the terminal. I mentioned this at the check in counter, they offered no apology and barely spoke English.

After boarding the plane, I noticed several passengers who were not wearing face masks correctly. The cabin crew didn’t care, were more concerned about selling snacks to passengers as apposed to passengers safety. I learned from staff at Istanbul that my luggage was going direct to Bodrum and there was no need to collect in Istanbul and re check in again. Something that staff in Egypt failed to mention?

The landing in Bodrum was perfect, one of the best I’ve experienced. The captains communication throughout the flight also good. The cabin crew over the tannoy system sounded distorted and muffled. I Could barely understand what they were trying to say? My luggage was not at the baggage reclaim in the domestic terminal. My luggage had been sent to the international terminal.

I had to walk there from the domestic terminal to collect it. No representative gave me instructions. I had to ask ground staff who barely spoke English. I had to use Google translate on my phone. Overall a not very enjoyable experience.",11,"2020",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Disgusting airline","They had made my sister and mum miss their flights because they went to pay for luggage but was taking a long time to attend to them.

Don’t fly with them, treat people with disrespect and don’t care about those of different country and colour.",11,"2020",1

"Pegasus-Airlines","Disgraceful","DO NOT BOOK WITH THEM. Even if you are saving some money, I wish I had paid extra and flown with any other airline. Extremely rude staff and when we a group of 15!of us got to the airport, and told us that we had cancelled our flights, Why would we even turn up at the airport if we had cancelled our flights ourselves!! Staff were very rude and left us with no choice to rebook our flight home, absolutely disgusting! When we try to explain what had happened they don’t care and very un apologetic.",10,"2020",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Do not book with them! They create fake flights!","This airline are criminally negligent. DO NOT USE!

Avoid at all costs unless you want to take the risk of your flight being cancelled with no notice and no compensation given.

Myself and my partner were flying back from Turkey with them, on a midday flight. When we booked there had been 3 flight options for the day with Pegasus. We chose the most expensive of the three because it meant we would get home in the afternoon rather than midnight or dawn (something a lot of us appreciate).

We get to the airport with lots of time, and are unceremoniously told that our flight has been cancelled. No email no calls, nothing. They give no reason or excuse. They say we are now booked onto the 10pm flight, and actually say we are lucky not to get charged by them for the flight rescheduling!!! We ask for compensation and get nothing. After much complaining they give us a food voucher, telling us it entitles us to anything in the airport. We SPECIFICALLY ask what the limit on the voucher is (as we now have a 10 hour wait in this airport), and they say no limit.

Lo and behold, when we get through customs, the vouchers are only useable at the cheapest places, and for the equivalent of £2.50 MAXIMUM per person. Couldnt even get something gluten-free for my celiac girlfriend as nothing was available at that price.

When we get on the flight, what a surprise! Its ABSOLUTELY PACKED! no social distancing whatsoever, every seat taken. Asking other fliers, many were in the same boat (or plane) as me. Clearly the airline puts up several flights, and then cancels them on the day so they can pack everyone on one and save money.

Ended up getting home at 2:30am instead of 4pm, and spending an additional £50 for transportation from London home and 2 additional meals necessary due to the delays at the airport. And when I ask Pegasus formally for compensation, they use Coronavirus as an excuse. Pitiful.

Clearly they are yet another company that doesn't actually give a toss for its customers, or its on-site staff. I felt sorry for the poor people checking all of us in, getting nothing but angry customers who they then have to lie to about why their trips are disrupted.",10,"2020",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst airline company ever","Where do I start? First the onboarding was delayed with one hours because the crew was so slow, after that we waited one more hour inside the plane because of bad weather, after that the flight started and the pilot pushed the brakes in the middle of the road and said that the flight was cancelled due to bad weather. After one more hour (total of 3 hours) they said that they will continue with the flight anyway and just have to change the crew because their time was off. FYI the crew SOLD drinks and food to the passengers instead of compensating them for the massive delay! After 3 and half hours delay we finally went to Antalya.

We wrote to their customer support for the compensation that we are entitled to and after a month they responded that we are not entitled to a compensation because the flight was cancelled due to corona???? You have to be joking because first of all the flight was not cancelled at all - there was nearly 4 hours delay, second of all - the crew told us that it was because of the bad weather.

Such a bad way to lie and treat your customers like that! Worst experience ever. I prefer to fly 18 hours than with pegasus",10,"2020",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Surprisingly very good","We booked Pegasus flights for May but obviously couldn't fly so spoke to customer services who answered the phone immediately and changed our flight to October. They changed our flight times by an hour and sent us an email and phoned us to see if it was ok. The flight to Dalaman was excellent. Very clean. Flight attendants were excellent and were very helpful. Unfortunately the return flight was cancelled the day after we arrived and we had to book Easijet to get home which was dreadful and both our new cases were damaged. We phoned Pegasus for a refund on our return and is was back on our account in 24 hours. Excellent experience",10,"2020",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Rude flight attendants and a broken suitcase","I recently flew from Izmir to istanbul and then to Manchester. On the flight to Istanbul I was asleep with my foot slightly in the isle, I woke to it being rammed with the drinks trolley to which I let out a yelp. I received no apology, just a funny look. On the drinks trolley serving the plane, 4 rows were ignored. Mine being one of these. When we landed I went to pick up my mothers £300 Antler suitcase that I had borrowed for the holiday to find it broken in 3 places and badly scuffed. The handle half snapped, and two gashes in the sides of the case. On looking online it’s seems a constant complete is baggage being damaged. This does not happen on other airlines so what is the issue? I think you should speak to your baggage handlers. What am I supposed to do? Buy her a new suitcase? I would like a full refund on my flights to pay for the cost of a new one. Absolutely shocked and appalled.",10,"2020",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","WORST AIRLINE EVER","We booked a number of flights with Pegasus Airlines before our holiday and all of them were cancelled.

Firstly, before we even left our country of residence, they cancelled our flights which we then had to rebook, and that was cancelled. We have requested a refund but have yet to receive it. We got text messages saying it was cancelled but our agent was never notified. So then we had to deal with our agent and Pegasus which was very annoying.

Secondly, our flight from Kayseri to Athens was cancelled but the airline failed to notify us. We were left thinking that we had a flight to catch in two days to go to Athens. However, it was actually our hotel host that informed us that the flight was actually cancelled. We tried to get in contact with their customer service but was unable to reach them by phone or by whatsapp. Our host called the airline and that's when we were informed formally that it was cancelled but they weren't going to tell us for another 24 hours, and this was so then we wouldn't get a full refund. This is beyond atrocious.

We definitely don't recommend flying with Pegasus Airlines. If you have other options, even cycling to the country, go for it - you're probably better off and would be less stressed.

"Pegasus-Airlines","If flew to the place without delay, it's already good. A broken suitcase and other surprises are ""little things"".","Pegasus is a relatively budget company, main base in Sabiha Gokcen International Airport in Istanbul: from this airport, you can continue your flight to almost anywhere in the world. It is important now, when there are many restrictions due to pandemic covid, not all aero companies fly where you need it. This is where the positive qualities of the company end.
In fact, it is not that budgetary: most services are for extra many money. Minus: that there is no customer service: it is almost a mission not imposible to contact customer service and even more so to get a relevant answer from them, for example, on the topic of hand luggage. During covid, even a small suitcase, which is usually taken as carry-on baggage, must be checked in. You can carry a small bag, a backpack into the cabin. Their dimensions and the ability to carry a laptop without a backpack or a bag of duty free and more: everything is at the discretion of the Pegasus ground service worker. The ground service also does not work very efficiently: long long queues, even if you registered through the website. There is no separate check-in counter for hand luggage.
Even if the suitcase after the flight turned out to be without a handle, without wheels or badly injured: getting a response from customer service is very small.
Even if there is a report from the airport that the suitcase has been confirmed, the customer service will take time and give different answers that do not correspond to the previous answer.

During my flight in the middle of a second COVID 19 wave they chose filled the plane without any respect to social distance. No middle seats where leaved empty. If you want to fly safe and without worries you have to consider this. I experienced their pricing as manipulative and in some sense a “price trap”. If you book your ticket in advance at eg premium carrier you will pay the same as for Pegasus and get more value for money (more bagage allowance, in flight entertainment, meal, service oriented crew). Conclusion money oriented instead of service oriented and little respect for safety with regard to Covid-19.",9,"2020",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Great Airline","We have used this Airline 8 times in the last 2 years. I really like this Airline. Its hassle free the aircraft are clean and comfortable. Staff are always polite and helpful. Flights are always on time if not early. I would have no qualms in recommending this Airline",9,"2020",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Problem free flights","We have just been away on holiday to Marmaris and we flew both ways via Pegasus Airways (Manchester airport) , this was our first time flying with them

Because of Covid -19 our hand luggage was placed in the hold (max 8kg), both outward and return flights departed on time but outgoing flight was more comfortable than the return flight, on board service was acceptable

For our first time flying with Pegasus, I have no complaints",9,"2020",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Mr","The worst airlines that I ever seen in my life...
My advice to everyone: Don’t save money on your life. Today I faced with technical issue of the plane 3rd time. And this is my last flight via Pegasus...",9,"2020",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Cancelled flight due to Covid","I received a text from Pegasus to say the return flight was cancelled. I logged onto the website which didn't have the specific info yet so I called the line I googled for Pegasus contact details.

It was answered quickly and my query dealt with friendly and efficiently. I was offered other options for flights which I didn't take and was told, no problem, the full amount for both flights would be refunded asap (which will take 3 to 5 days).

I wouldn't hesitate to book with Pegasus again (assuming the money gets refunded : )",9,"2020",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","No Refund","More than six months and until now no refund was received of the canceled flight.

They keep telling after two months of the flights reopen.

Is this a customer issue? is there any way to escalate this?

"Pegasus-Airlines","Really happy with Customer Service","With current coronavirus stuff going on, I was very please to have been able to reach customer service number UK based without any issues, on average it took few minutes to wait to be answered and all my questions/queries were addressed (I had to reach out with 4 separate matters). Unlike other lines when I changed my mind and cancelled my flight I received 50% refund which is better then none refund at all with other flights like Wizzair for instance.",9,"2020",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Terrible service","Pegasus has terrible service. Not client oriented. Flight from Antlya to Istanbul was late due to their technical problem. I pointed out to the fligjt attendand that we will be late for next fligjt and asked for help. He just said go to the transfer desk. On arrival in Istanbul I asked if we can get off the plane first since we need to run for international flight and try catch it but all I got was very rude no and some rude comments in turkish language. This airline has the worst in flight service. They act as if they are the stars and we should be grateful for flying with them. Terrible. I have not got enough words ro describe my disappointment with this airline.",9,"2020",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Budget Flight","There isn't much legroom however is cheap. The staff are very helpful and their service is amazing especially if you are Turkish. Would haven no complaints about comfort as it is an economy class flight. The food does taste good however is not my cup of tea. There are not much corona precautions as there is no socially distancing they only require you too wear your face masks during the whole flight",9,"2020",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Not a bad experience - can be better!!","This was my first holiday where I've used PEGASUS for my return travel as well as my domestic flights in Turkey. Pleasantly surprised with the service and the quality of the flights. On my return flight I came to the airport very early and was glad to see many empty counters. However, my hopes to check in early was dashed as the staff refused to check me in early. I was made to wait for 2.30hrs before they checked in my luggage - why can't they check in luggage all the time like DUBAI/ UK airports?!!",9,"2020",3

"Pegasus-Airlines","Full refund and clear communication for cancelled flight","My flight was cancelled due to Covid-19. Pegasus kept me informed throughout the process and offered immediate vouchers. When I asked for full refund they told me they will issue that after two months. Unlike some other airlines, there was not a massive wait time to talk to their support team over the phone. As promised they issued full refund back to my account. My other family/friends who booked their holidays with other airlines are not even able to catch the airline on the phone let alone get refund!!! So I am really glad I made by booking with them and will definately use them going forward as they are full more trustworthy.",8,"2020",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","A VERY GOOD EXPERIENCE!","We used Pegasus airlines on our recent visit to the magnificent city of Istanbul. From booking of flights to receiving our boarding passes was all online and simple. At airports to/from istanbul, Pegasus airlines staff was polite,friendly and helpful. At Sabiha Gokcen airport in Istanbul, self service machines of Pegasus are a good idea that actually saved us time.",8,"2020",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Refund","I received a refund from cancelled flights (April 20) well done Pegasus. I was told that my funds would be paid once the flights had been reinstated for 2 months - I think I have received it earlier than the 2 months stated.Thank you",8,"2020",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Damaged Baggage!","I got back to Manchester and realised my case was all cracked at the bottom and the wheel was hanging off. I went to the baggage desk and she told me there was nothing she could do as the baggage was labelled as damaged when it was checked in! They were new cases!! She told me to take it up with Pegasus.
Since getting home I have realised all 3 cases have damaged on! When in fact the other 2 are perfectly fine! So why are they labelled with damaged also?
I emailed Pegasus explaining this and they replied nothing they could do as my baggage wasn't up to the travel standards and it is unsuitable for checked baggage?!
As stated above my case was brand new, not a scratch on it!! They refused to pay out for the damage they have caused and now ignore my emails.
I am sure they put damaged on cases so they don't have to pay out for the damage they make!!!
This company is disgusting and I will never fly with them again!",8,"2020",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","God awful!! Flight crew were very rude!!","I flew with this god awful airline in October 2019. The flight from Stansted airport to North Cyprus was delayed for two hours, no reason was given. The flight crew were rude and lacked even the most basic customer service skills. The seat was tiny and uncomfortable with many people overlapping in their seats including myself and i am average built man, the flight was absolutely horrendous. It cost 4 euro for a small coke. I will never fly with this airline again. Worst flight i have ever taken. Avoid at all costs!!",8,"2020",1

"Pegasus-Airlines","Check in hand luggage or you pay 70€ fine","We came at the airport to check in for our flight with small backpacks and bags and the ground steward told us to check them in which we firstly refused because we had important stuff inside. She proceeded to tell us we can get a 70€ fine if we didn’t comply . On top of that these employees are not even trained to know basic information which they had to look on the website for, for example, they asked for a medical certificate from my pregnant wife which we didn’t have because we called to Pegasus and saw on the website it was not required . Staff were rude and kept asking unnecessary questions killing our time. We had to fit everything in our luggages because we couldn’t take it with us. Nowhere have we gotten informed about this new stupid rule of theirs, it makes no freaking sense why “just rules”.",8,"2020",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Excellent flight but food...","We had a very pleasant flight going from London to Istanbul. The plane was clean, check in was hassle free, no delays and a good overall experience. The only downfall was the sandwich which we had reserved online. The bread was very stale and the ingredients had very little flavour. Would I book again? For the price we paid and the overall service, certainly (with my own sandwich!). Also, make sure you have something to keep you entertained as in flight entertainment is non existent.",8,"2020",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Brilliant airline","Wasn’t sure about this airline when I read the reviews but decided to chance it in the end. Lovely aircraft plenty of leg room and the plane was very very clean. Flight attendance were super friendly and helpful. Will defiantly use Pegasus airlines in the future.",8,"2020",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Still no refund?!!?","Why won’t you give me back my money you crooks? An absolute disgrace that you refuse to give people their money back.

I was told 5 months ago that I would get my money back 2 months after when the restrictions would start to be lifted. Phone call after phone call and now they are telling me that it’ll be when all restrictions are lifted. This could be 1-2 years time!!!

I did not have money that day during my flight and neither could pay with euros! I was feeling very sick during the flight because I could not take my pill and I was very annoyed by them refusing me just 50 ml of water. Calling to their customer service, they literally refused to assist me, even though I told them it was an emergency and I could not pay at all!
Terrible experience. If I fainted, nobody would ever offer me water, but the first thing for them would have been to ask me to purchase it. Really terrible passenger treatment....",8,"2020",1

"Pegasus-Airlines","Can't use open ticket to book a new flight","Pegasus made me pay £76 in penalties for converting my existing ticket to an open ticket, despite announcing on their website there would be no penalties. This was during Covid -19 pandemic when all flights were grounded. Although my original trip isn't until end of August, with the government advice changing everyday and I feel genuinely anxious about flying during the pandemic, I converted my ticket to an open ticket. I'm outraged that Pegasus charged me additional fee on top of my original ticket that cost me £234. I've written to complain and also called UK call centre which cut me off and Pegasus doesn't have the courtesy to respond!
Worst airline and customer services in my experience.
I'm now trying to use my open ticket to book a flight for July next year and website tells me NO flights, it's so frustrating to have paid a total of £310 and can't even get a flight.
Can anyone please tell me where I can escalate my complaint to?
Thanks",7,"2020",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","The worst ever experience","The worst ever experience. To cut the story short they charged me four times x £250 =£1000 when I tried to reissue my family's open ticket over their corrupt website, while the booking didn't get through! After so many calls and email for two weeks, one of their guys phoned and said he would do the booking on the phone and refund that £1000. He charged me £448 as the price had gone up. However, the booking didn't also go through!!! I demanded the cancellation of the original booking with a full refund of £377. At that point they owed me £1825. After three weeks, they decided to be ""so generous"" and refund £1198 only!!! I spent hours on the phone demanding the remaining £627 and sent many emails that end up in a black hole. Their call centre people are well trained to bring the call to a deadlock. My holiday was ruined and my finance suffered and I am still hopelessly calling every morning and sending emails.",7,"2020",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Bad service not refunding","Pegasus cancelled my flights in March still not had refund. Had flights booked for 28 August
Only when looking at there website found flight from Istanbul to sharm had been cancelled. After speaking to them they changed flights to 27 August £54 cheaper. But only cheaper if get refund.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice..I will never use this airline again.","I had previously had a bitter experience on board with this airline, but since they claimed to have flights now, I decided I'd give a second chance. Biggest mistake of my life.
My ticket was booked on 8.7.2020 to fly to Istanbul. A week later (note also a week before the trip) I received a message saying my flight was canceled. The options given were either to change the tickets(not an option as this was supposed to be a one-time trip, for an event that only takes place once - I don""t intend to visit Turkey any other time) or call a number for refund. The number given is inactive. I had to do my own research, wasting time and money for calls to Turkey and whatnot, to finally after two days and another 40 minutes on the line waiting for somebody to pick up, I finally succeeded. The phone was picked up by the so very not interested to do his job Mr. Alih (thanks again for nothing) who monotonously explained the procedure of refund takes two months and he cannot do anything for me but cancel my tickets(cancel my tickets?!? The whole flight is canceled, what else do you want?). Very alarming was also the fact that I won""t be receiving any kind of confirmation for this cancellation - so I just sit there, you took my money that I gave to you a week ago, telling me you need 2 months to give it back?!? Added to the horrific service on board and the difficulties I had last time, this officially makes Pegasus airline by far the worst I""ve ever flown with.

I didn't get any refund for about 3 months now. the customer service keep telling me that they returned the money which is a lie of course. Be aware, they will scam you hard..",7,"2020",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Great customer service","I booked duplicated flights and was amazed at how straightforward it was to cancel and get a full refund!

"Pegasus-Airlines","Biggest scammers in flying history.","Worst airline and a bunch of scammers.

Flew to Vienna over turkey in January. They shut down the airport and canceled all flights. Turkish Air had their costumers in planes within 4h.

Pegasus on the other hand canceled all the flights for 24h. No refunds, no new ticket, nothing. Useless employees. I had to buy two new tickets -(for me and my wife) just to be able to leave. That's 800€. I was assured once in Vienna I will be refunded for the new ticket and the 24h!!!! delay.

Guess what. They lied. I have been in a legal battle with them for the past 6 month. Their costumer support is taught to never ever accept refunds and keep you on thd telephone line so you pay (2€/minute) untill you have a huge mobile bill and have to cut the connection. Sending you from one service member to the other.

The customer service also lied multiple times about handling the issue. They wanted to postpone it long enough to forfeit my right for legal action.

Which I noticed and contacted my lawyer.

As of today they owe me 1.600 euros as refund for the new tickets and refund for the tickets they canceled.

It was the 7th Jan. and Istanbul Airport was a sh*tshow. The people Pegasus refused, a couple of hundred were getting Realy angry. What did Pegasus do? They pulled all employees from all the help desks for 6h!!! leaving us behind with zero info and no way back home.

I had no idea that somebody else also has my seat until we got into the plane. Even airport authorities were shocked how this can be possible! Doesn’t the airline use computers yet?! Their IT system should be so primitive that it couldn’t catch such a basic error and their employee as well! Finally after so much arguing and a long delay we flew but I missed my other flight and they didn’t accept any responsibility! Don’t recommend them!",7,"2020",1

Why they looked at my recidency card and didn't tell me? Was waiting 8 hours at the airport and they didn't let me go into the plane. No refund again.My husband paid fine in Doha( he could pay within those 8 hours I was waiting the day before if they would let me know)and I bought 3rd ticket to Doha but this time they didn't let me into the plane because only Qatari citizens could fly.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Robbed my Money -Making everyone Aware Case number:02338409","On the 17th March I purchased a ticket to fly to Istanbul, Turkey from their website. There was no indication turkey would close its border on the website, google etc due to COVID as it’s a very fluid situation.

On the 18th when I arrived at the desk to check-in my bags I was informed that Turkey had now closed its borders due to COVID. I spoke to the manager and he told me I was due a full refund and to call the customer service hotline to instigate this. This was a major inconvenience as I was hoping for an instant refund and I ended up paying 1700 to fly to Dublin a few hours later.

I was assured by their customer service a full refund would be issued and then heard nothing for a few weeks. They tried to claim I didn’t show up for the flight/I cancelled it myself and didn’t want to fly etc which wasn’t the case.

Online there is dozens of complaints from other dissatisfied customers who haven’t been issued refunds and it seems this is the route the company is taking. They issued me with a refund of 23.56 euro which also doesn’t make sense?!

Essentially they have held onto money which isnt theres. They didn't provide the service which I was entitled to and have absolutely no reason to be holding onto my money.

I presented myself at the airport.

Told i couldn't fly due to COVID

Proper solution from a company who doesn't engage in robbery:

Issue full refund which will hit account in 7-10 working days

Pegasus Solution: Keep the money, tell the customer they are lying and also lose customer who would fly with them many times in the future.

I called them several times, their customer services are the worst on earth and the most rude, they put you on hold and keep you waiting for 15 minutes till the line goes off, finally after they answered my calls they said no solution, raise a complaint and since 2 month now i didn't receive any reply, I called again today and they wanted to refund after the pandemic ends, wtf is this, there is no date, no law , nothing that entitles a merchant to take the money of customers and keep it with them when they fail to deliver the services they offered.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Terrible experience horrible company sinister tactics","Appreciate that during COVID-19 things can be tough for an airline. However, Pegasus cancelled my return flight then failed to mention that they had some flights going back to the UK nor that they could help me with accommodation, food or lodging. They basically stranded me and left me to fend for myself without any support. Their solution was to offer a return flight in May, leaving me stranded for 6 weeks.

This is a terrible company and without any responsibility for the people they carry. They have shown me that they genuinely do not care at all about any human being,

I asked and pleaded with them to help me get back to my family and even then, they didn’t offer a place on a flight back to the UK. Furthermore, they mentioned force majeure and government mandate as to the reason why they cancelled their flight. However, the UK didn’t close its borders, so the flight back had no issues taking off and bringing people back to their homes and families.

Pegasus are liars and a terrible company. I implore anyone reading this, avoid Pegasus no matter what and do not take a flight with this company. They are horrible and will leave you stranded as soon as anything gets remotely tough.

I bought a separate ticket with Turkish Airlines and flew back that way. Funny how Turkish Airlines could fly back but Pegasus couldn’t… Absolutely dishonest.",4,"2020",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Not refunding. Saying it's all my fault.","Arrived to Amman on March 14 at 6 pm. Got into my hotel and found out the country is going into full lockdown with all flights suspended starting March 17. Tried reaching Russia, English, Arabic hotlines for several hours until I ran out of money on my cellphone. The best solution seemed to be to change my flight back to Ankara through their app. And I did. I was all alone in a foreign country. My embassy basically told me it was my own problem. I have no Arabic skills and no money to say, to hell everything, I'll just stay stuck here for a month or so. I paid 64 dollars and flew back to Ankara on March 15 (the original flight was supposed to be March 19). I sent a request to refund 64 dollars because it was a force major situation and Pegasus wasn't exactly there to help me out. After two weeks of silence I called English hotline. The angry lady told me it was my own desire to change the flight so there will no refund. Of course! Country going into lockdown is my own desire. She said she would put my reservation into some high priority list but I knew it was a lie. That was confirmed when I reached Russia hotline yesterday. Another angry lady said such list doesn't exist and there are no remarks or special notes tagged to my reservation. She also told me there would be no refund because it was my own wish to change the flight. She had the audacity to tell me that force major happens everywhere now so I was supposed to cancel my original flight and get a new ticket at the airport. So basically she told me I should have risked the only chance to get out of the country and hope that I'll be seated on a plane that was fully booked by the time I arrived to the airport and people were basically lying on the floor waiting for another flight next day or maybe never.
She also said they receive hundreds of calls every day and I was just the unlucky one. Well thank you very much, I guess that lifts any responsibility from the airline.

The situation was no joke. I did what I did to escape. And the airline wasn't there. That lady also told me they would have gotten me out in any case. Another lie. All flights were suspended. People were and are still stuck in Jordan. Many Jordanians are still stuck in another countries because there are just now flights. But yeah they would definitely allow a lowcoster company to fly in and out.

It was my first ever experience with Pegasus and it will be the last. Pegasus shows such insensitive outrageous attitude that I would never step on board of their plane even if it was for free.",3,"2020",1

Excellent plane (very new, very clean, reasonably comfortable seats), wonderful cabin staff. Plane was on time, flight was smooth and pleasant. I could not ask for more. My only complaint: the check-in at Kayseri was quite chaotic. No proper lines for queuing, check-in staff were harried and few in number. Perhaps this had nothing to do with the airline, it may be the airport's fault! All in all, a great experience. I would gladly fly again with them. (I kept their in-flight mag as a souvenir, on going through it I find that Pegasus has a very extensive domestic network in Turkey and quite a few international routes.)",3,"2020",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Full Refund in 24 hours - covid 19 cancellations","Full Refund in 24 hours for flights cancelled due to corona virus. London to Dubai via Istanbul, Istanbul to Dubai flight was cancelled due to travel restrictions which meant entire journey was cancelled. One phone Call to find out options and few clicks on the app and refund was processed into my account after 24 hours. Hassle free with no cancellation charges.",3,"2020",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Easiest Refund imaginable","Due to the Corona-outbreak we had to cancel our flight.
After a terrible experience with Expedia, I was prepared for dozens of annoying callcentre calls to get my money back.
With Pegasus it literally took 3 clicks to cancel and the amount was back in my bank account within days. Brilliant service!",3,"2020",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","customer service","Having enjoyed a flight from Stansted ,i was due to fly onward to Riyadh from Istanbul.Emergency restrictions placed upon foreigners meant this was not possible,as the airline were not willing to allow me passage.I believe this to have been a wrong interpretation of the rules on their part.However,once that decision had been made the customer service i received was first class.Arrangements were made for my overnight accommodation and return journey home.",3,"2020",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Stranded","We have been left stranded in hurghada with no hope of getting home, when we asked what we can do they said we can have a refund that’s it ... so basically they just want to get us out of the way. Great customer service",3,"2020",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","First and good experience!!","Due to coronavirus pandemic many flights are getting cancel now a days. As my Turkish airline cancelled the flight with a prior notice, I had no chance but to find an alternative flight.

I booked Pegasus airline two days ahead of my flight. Expectations were low but both flights from Geneva to Istanbul and then Istanbul to Dubai were on time. It has sufficient legroom of 6 feet tall person.

Meal and in-flight entertainment are not included and one needs to book it separately by paying additional. In-flight entertainment has limited options, which I don't recommend and seats are not adjustable.",3,"2020",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Avoid at ALL Cost!!!","Dont witte that menu reviews but pegasus really forced me into it. Had 4 flights from Amsterdam to Istanbul and then to the Gulf for vacation. 1 word: absolutely worthless airline. The flight attendants hate their jobs and were actually yelling at people. Some didnt even welcome or say goodbye to travellers. Its a budget airline so no problem, but they are absolutely unreliable. They cancelled multiple flights without reason and are unavailable after through email and telephone. When you do reach them after waiting an hour on the phone, they are rude and give u misinformation. Immediately they will offer a refund, but never a solution. when its ur flight home and u get told to go figure it out Youssef, after rebooking multiple Cancelled flights something might seem structurally wrong with this airline. Their local office even tell you to book a different airline.

The culture both at checkin, in the plane and at customer service is the same. you pay a lot more than you think you are when booking them, pray to God you dont need them if u do book them. Same for Turkish airlines the mother company. They should send their money on cudstomers instant of ads with Messi. Shyson Thomas should be ashamed of himself.

Eventually forcefully went back with Qatar Airlines and absolutely BIG difference.

every day a txt of cancellation because of half empty flights.
Never again Pegasus, id rather walk",3,"2020",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","The least enjoyable flight","Due to unforeseen circumstances(Spread of Coronavirus in Italy) I had to cut short our holidays and buy two one- way tickets from Rome through Istanbul to Tbilisi. Despite paying a considerable sum of money, the flight wasn’t one of out best, to say the least. The level of cleanliness was deplorable and flight attendants weren’t that friendly. Yet, I would not have written a negative review if one thing hadn’t infuriated me. Namely, the end of February was when the outbreak of Coronavirus started in Italy and the country was on the point of lockdown. Nevertheless, when we arrived at Istanbul Gogchen airport, none of the passengers were made to go through a medical or thermo check-up. People arriving from the hotspot of epidemics mingled with hundreds of other people. Such a shame for the airport that is said to belong to Pegasus Airlines. Due to such irresponsible actions the situation dramatically changes for the worse.",3,"2020",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Walked off tired and sick","Miserable flight for my daughters. But cheap. Plane was stuffy, Seats didn't lay back, no free water, no entertainment. My daughter got travel sickness for the first time. I would fly it again I just myself, but not with kids.",3,"2020",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Couldnt check in, Terrible customer service","Could check in online, then they cancelled our flights. Pegasus gave the money back. Then they eventually flew again and sold the plane tickets, to other people for much higher prices. We never even got the chance to get our tickets back. Customer service was very rude at the airport. (SAW)

I assume this was because they could sell them at much higher prices than initially sold for, because they did offer me a plane ticket a day later at 5(!) times the original cost of my ticket. Never flying again with Pegasus.",3,"2020",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Not fit for long haul flights- Buy neck support before boarding any Pegasus flight- bed euros to even buy water-:(","I traveled with wife and teenage son to Turkey and then to Saudi for holidays. Flights were cheap and ran on time without any issues except the fixed seats are so uncomfortable that even a young healthy person would end up with me neck and shoulder pain. Due to their fixed position, you cannot relax and move the seat back to have a nap or support your head which means throughout the flight your head is at 90 degrees to rest of your body and no entertainment means you are bored to death- cannot even sleep. I had never travelled on Pegasus before so suffered the consequences of not knowing budget airlines and onboard facilities.i needed water but because I was travelling from Saudi I did not have euros in me so I could even buy water for 3 and half hour long flight- pathetic customer services that staff don’t even feel humane enough to offer you courtesy water due to not having the right currency- 21st century and this is value of life saving drops of water!!",3,"2020",2

"Pegasus-Airlines","Flights on Time but Planes and Service Basic","I flew Stansted to Istanbul return for work as they were the only airline flying to Sabiha Gokcen the day I went out. Both flights were on time but the seats were hard and did not recline, the catering is awful and the staff OK. My Turkish colleagues always prefer to fly Turkish Airways and I can understand why. The day before I flew back one of their planes had overshot the runway at Istanbul, broken in 3 with 2 dead. I would not choose to use them again but would if I had too , just consider then as Ryanair",3,"2020",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","The worst airline ever regarding customer services","They have cancelled all the flights from Italy and Iran to Turkey due to Corona Virus which is understandable but they do have not done the refund yet after 7 days!

"Pegasus-Airlines","Interesting prices","Good price and good service in Holland. On our way back again, like last year, problems with check-in with our lugage. Finally it was solved but not that easy.
The service in the plane was very well, good personel.",3,"2020",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","THE WORST COMPANY.","On my long experience as Frequent Flier I can surely affirm that Pegasus is the worst company I have ever flew. While all the low cost companies by definition offer basic services this company simply has no consideration for its customers! After a several years during which I constantly flew Pegasus my luggage was delivered after a couple of days and was forced to by some basic stuff to survive ...... well they have been so clever to let me surrender and stop to claim reimbursement for the amount of money I spent and for which I was legally entitled to be reimbursed. Their tricky website and operators simply bring you to the point where you do not want to claim anythingh! This is NOT the way to consider customers! If you want to be considered and respected DO NOT FLY Pegasus, believe me!!!",3,"2020",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Review","This airline was just so bad. The service was just not acceptable. Delayed planes and shifted from one side of airport to the other. A very stressful experience. I would not recommend this airline at all to anyone. Way below economy class.",3,"2020",1

"Pegasus-Airlines","Terrible Service","Our flight was at 3 am. After the boarding, they realized there was a technical problem. we waited on the plane for a long time. Some passengers asked for an explanation, a stewardess started to talk to the passenger loudly and crossly. Then they decided to evacuate the plane. We were told to have a meal at McDonald's. After we had our meal we sat at the waiting lounge while constantly listening to the announcements and watching the info screens. After 7 hours there was still no news. We couldn't reach the info desk because we have had already passed the border. But after 7 hours we have talked to the police about our situation. When we reached the info desk we were told that all passengers were sent to a hotel. Nobody looked for us, nobody announced or nothing. When I wrote about our journey to Pegasus nobody reached me about this. This will be the last time I use this airline.",3,"2020",1

The flight from Istanbul to Beyrouth had 3 1/2 goes delay, without any explanation. The return flight has not than two hours delay. The explanation: the pilot wanted to wait for sunlight (the flight supposed to leave at night). This raises questions about the quality of the pilot training.
For your own safety and reliability, do NOT book this airline!",3,"2020",1

"Pegasus-Airlines","Problems, problems","Booked a return flight Charleroi Erzurum with stopover in SAW. After a few weeks Pegasus announced in an email that the flight SAW - Erzurum was canceled and that the flights Erzurum - Charleroi was not possible anymore in one day since the Erzurum-SAW flight was now sheduled after the flight SAW-Charleroi.
So I had to cancel the outboung flight (was refunded) and purchase a much more expensive Turkish airlines flight. For the inbound flight I had to take one hotel night in Istanbul. Additional problem was a departure from BRU and a homecoming in CRL. What about your car in CRL airport parking?
Needless to say I am not recommending the Pegasus airline.",3,"2020",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Not comparible with Turkish Airlines","Gives you a feeling that you are in a public transport. Could be OK for easyjet users but not suitable for me.

Unfortunately my grandpa passed away 2 days before the flight and I had to rush for the funeral. My tickets has no insurance neither a guarantee. That’s why I bought another tickets.
Without any expectation I went to Pegasus help desk and ask if they can do anything..?

I wasn’t expecting it but they refunded half of my payment. Actually, I had similar situation with other airways before and none Of them was trying to help even.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst airline ever","I went for umrah from Manchester to jeddah by Pegausus. I travelled all over the world used etihad emirates Pia and many others.but pegausus is the worst airline in the world.
We had a stop in Istanbul on the way to jeddah. Flight delays everywhere from Manchester first then in Istanbul and same on the way back.
They dont tell you the reason why flight is delayed. No customer service
I am from Pakistan and Pakistan local bus service is a lot better than pegausus. If you travelling with kids ,then you will cry onboard.
My advice to all people is that please dont believe on good reviews for booking through pegausus.
Its rubbish airline.small planes ,uncomfortable,
Travel agents perfer pegausus because its little bit cheap. Not too cheap.
Please avoid this airline.
There is lot more to write in this review because we had very rough time on every airport. No customer care on any airport from pegausus staff.
On Istanbul airport its said desk no 2g for pegausus, we went there ,they said no go to 2f went there,guy was on his mobile phone ,stood there like a idiot, after 5 min he said go to next desk ,its shows on top pegausus but he dont care, it was on Istanbul airport.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst airline ever","First off they are super unorganized. No one speaks English. Second they refuse to give you proper information on cancelations and delays. Our first flight got cancelled supposedly to bad weather conditions it took them two hours to give us any updates and they never told us the reason for the cancelation we had to do our own research. I requested a copy of our rights due to cancelation they denied it. Then we get put into a hotel where no one gives us proper information. On breakfast lunch or dinner times or when we need to be up in the front to head to the airport. We get back to the airport the next day. Super slow staff during check in, no gate assigned and flight is delayed three hours!!! Then they don’t tell us why they just tell us to sit.... Again do not use this airline. It is not worth it. I have been on some very bad airlines in the us but this has beef the worst. Good luck",3,"2020",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Flight to Dubai","After reading reviews on this airline I was very worried about my reservation which was Manchester to Istanbul then on to Dubai as I couldn't find any good reviews. I am pleased to say my worries were for nothing. We were informed on check in at Manchester that we would miss our connecting flight owing to a 3 hour delay,further information would be given on arrival in Istanbul. On arrival in Istanbul 3 hours late we found that the flight to Dubai had been delayed in order to wait for forward fliers on our flight.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Ok airline","We took Pegasus from JED to VIE, transiting in SAW.

The 4 flights (JED-SAW, SAW-VIE, VIE-SAW, SAW-JED) went smoothly, almost on time, no problems at check in and boarding. Other than having to buy food and water and no ICE I couldn't tell the difference that this is a budget airline. The only complaint was the leg space. They really crimp on

3 days before our flight, one of Pegasus planes overshot the runway but we were not aware of the news. Ignorance is bliss as they say. Otherwise we would have worried whether we could trust Pegasus pilots.

SAW is a proper airport even though it largely caters to LCC. I would even think SAW is livelier and more spacious than VIE.",2,"2020",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Gets you there!","We were very late leaving Copenhagen. But the crew were easy and relaxed and didn’t act stressed. They had a calming effect. Pegasus doesn’t feel like a budget Company, you will need to pay for anything to eat or drink but they don’t push you.

I reconmend Pegasus.",2,"2020",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Pegasus was a positive airline to me","I canceled my ticket 4 hours before boarding, then they refunded euro 30 to me at once, I originally paid euro 70 (the cheapest plan). after 3 days, the funds had been reached to my account.

"Pegasus-Airlines","This is not a budget airline. Can't recommend it to anyone for many reasons.","I had 4 flights in 1 week from Manchester to Jeddah stopover in Istanbul. The airline can't be recommended for following reasons;

1. No Screen, No entertainment in flight, even no clock. You feel in yourself in a detention room for few hours;

2. No free meal or free water or free tissue paper, charged good fare equal to an international airline of good reputation such as Qatar, BA etc;

3. Pilots are silent, they never speak and will never tell you who he is, or where you are going etc;

4. Small planes with less leg room and small toilets

5. Better pay £50 to £100 extra and find a reasonable airline;

6. Food sold in the airline is very expensive;

She is absolutely Zero customer service Zero behavior doesn’t deserve to be a guest contact. She express her bad attitude asked me to remove and throw my suites and food to the bin “ You can throw in the garbage bin if you want”; excuse me this is the solution and alternative solution you providing . Instead she should inform and advise me politely that I have an access luggage which I agree and I`m not denying it, it`s the mistake of check in counter did not ask or advise us therefore we thought its fine to carry as two of us travelling.It`s extremely wrong to come last minute at boarding time and you start weighing bags and stopping client from flight it`s completely unprofessional and your staff made our trip the worst ever.

Staff couldn’t care less about connecting flights being missed, which might have been an issue if flight were actually on time!

EXPENSIVE: looks cheap but then you have to add luggage so it comes back to normal airline price.
I only take this airline for lack of choice when comingfrom marseille to beirut and back in the winter.
Also, the Sabiha airport where we stop is the worst : it's overcrowded, no wifi, you have to consume something for the wifi (and not at any restaurant, they inform you AFTER youve already made a purchase) the staff are horrible.

Also even a cup of water is paid and expensive for no reason.",2,"2020",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Extremely bad treatment","I was on a flight from Sarajevo to Istanbul when the accident happens at the Pegasus airport in Turkey. After we finally landed, there was only minimum help provided by the company. The agony lasted for hours, and they never ever offered to passengers anything to eat or drink. They left elderly people, parents with small children, and did not make them as a priority. But, their treatment of women is horrifying. They ignore us, yell at us, insult and treat women in such a degrading way that they should be forbidden from working completely. Plus, leaving people with no water and food for over 12 hours, and asking nobody is they need any kind of assistance, is shocking. I never ever experienced something like this. This company should not be allowed to work with people.",2,"2020",1

After a terrible stay at a hotel they offered I could leave for Munich the day after. Not my final destination but the best they could offer if I didnt want to wait 3 more days.

They can send to airport but ask me to provide them an responsibility statement that I accept all responsibilty in case of any damage or loss with my sign on it.
Is the reasonable?
No baggage tag is their mistake.
I have not get any compensation and luggage.
Their reply is really slow.",2,"2020",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Because of recommendations....","I am posting this to show that because of the poor reviews that Pegasus airlines receives, I did not purchase a ticket. I bought from another airline that cost more because I wanted to be sure I would get to my destination without any issues.",2,"2020",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Average Low Cost Carrier","There are only two routes from AYT to ASR in winters. We chose the afternoon one. There was a huge group of school children travelling in our flight which caused the regular and the online check in counter to be full. We were checked in last. And it had gotten so late until then that we had to run to catch the flight, with no fault of our own and they were closing the gates when we reached and we had to convince them not to. They should add more counters when they know the flight is that full.

The legroom was good. Rest everything was average",2,"2020",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Very Impressed","We recently travelled with Pegasus to Sharm from Manchester via Istanbul and we were not disappointed. Unfortunately on the way back we missed our connecting flight due to an incident at Istanbul Airport. As we Arrived at Istanbul Airport very late we were told to collect our luggage then to report to the Pegasus desk to rearrange our flights. We were told there wasnt an available flight for two days but would arrange a mini bus to take us to a 5 star Hotel Full Board overlooking the sea with Spa all paid for and would pick us up to take us back the Airport!!! We obviously were very impressed with this service and say a big thank you for looking after us they way that you did.",2,"2020",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst ever experience - Very rude crew","I was flying with Pegasus on 04.Jan.2020 from Skopje to Istanbul on flight no. PC 352 with my wife and daughter. I want to complain on two of the flight attendants. Their names are Mutlu and Elena. When we were boarding, we reached our seat and we had only one carry on bag for the three of us and the overhead luggage compartment was full by other passengers. I called Mutlu and told him that we need to put our bag because this compartment is for our seats. He was answering in a rude way saying ""No this is not your place"". I told him: there is no logic in what you are saying, the compartment should be allocated for passengers of the same row. What if I have important things in my bag and it gets stolen? Are you going to be held responsible? Where in the world can you find such a logic?"". This will be definitely a messy situation if randomly every passenger will place their luggage where ever they want. Mutlu was rude and I did not want to make a drama, so I moved to the far end and placed our bag in the compartment.

Later on, 30 minutes before reaching Istanbul, my wife called the flight attendant ""Elena"" and my wife asked her nicely to bring the bag for us before landing because the passengers will be standing and then we have to wait for all passengers to evacuate and then we can go through the isle to get our bag. Elena refused to help us saying that she cannot do that for us. I told her why should we suffer because of your unorganized behavior? She kept arguing that the compartment is not allocated for us. She was so rude with us the way she is talking to us.

After landing, we were waiting until the plane clears out, then I went to take the bag and as we approached the exit, I asked gently for the IDs and names of these two flight attendants, Mutlu said to me you cannot take a photo of the ID. I told him I don't want to take a photo, I want the ID number and name because I want to complain. They were hiding their ID cards. I said to them why you are not showing the cards? Is this a war secret? You are supposed to identify yourself. At the end Mutlu was writing his name and Elena's first name only. They didn't show their ID information which is supposed to be exposed. They did not even give me their surnames.",1,"2020",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","The bare minimum","No frills flight. Not enough space between rows. I felt bad for heavier people who were sandwiched in. The least they could do is offer water. Crew should tell passengers to use headphones when listening to their devices. So rude.",1,"2020",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Very low customer satisfaction","The first experience and for sure will be the last since they don't care about long term customers.
Disappointed in the way that I tried to buy some snacks on board but the card machine was not connecting and the crew didn't accept the origin flight currency.
On the return I had to deal with an unpleasant agent that obliging me to pay for extra 3kg even that I informed I didn't have a hand luggage.
The seats are very uncomfortable and can't be adjusted.
So far the worst low cost carrier that I had to deal on region.",1,"2020",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Surprised in a good way!","I looked at reviews before booking my flights from London to Doha via Istanbul and let’s be honest, I wasn’t gonna book anything with them. I then looked at other airlines, but they were 2 to 3 times more expensive than Pegasus so I decided to give them a chance!

I wasn’t expecting much, but was impressed! Both of our planes (from London to Istanbul and then Istanbul to Doha) were clean and my partner, who is 6”1, had enough space for his legs. I see some people in the reviews expecting a business class plane, no, don’t expect that! Of course not. You get what you pay for! Don’t expect a tv, some free food and extra extra comfy seats where you can lay in! It’s a low cost airline! But it’s 100% does the job. Both of our flights were on time (we even arrived a bit earlier in Doha) and really don’t regret our journey. The staff was okay as well.

The only down sides are the website and the online check-in!",1,"2020",4

"Pegasus-Airlines","Rip off.","Got a price on their website for return flight to Istanbul. Went through the whole rigmarole of adding seats, etc. to get to a final price of some £360. Which I believed was quite good. Only for the system to time me out when trying to pay and finally tell me ""a problem has occured, please try again"". Which I did and hey presto this time the price is £20 more expensive. Oh well, tried to pay, same problem. Third time lucky the flights some £100 more expensive. Does Pegasus want to know? Of course not; their response ""We would not want you to have such an experience that made you feel this way. Due to the company policies, we are unable to help you in this regard.""
First and last time with Pegasus therefore.",1,"2020",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Charged 150€ for duty free items","Was traveling from Rome to Dubai via Istanbul. At the boarding in Rome was told by company staff that, quote:

No invoice, no anything. Grabbed my 150€, put in his coat, told me he has no change, and that I can go board the plane now.
Racketeering right in the airport.
Sent e-mail to airport, got reply that company may deny boarding for whatever reason they seem fit.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Good Flight. Language Barrier.","We have just flown from Stansted to Istanbul. We flew economy, no extra leg room as just a 3hr 45min flight! We actually got to Istanbul about 20mins early which is great! Didn’t use the entertainment app on board, no screens in seat. We had a complimentary cheese roll on board which was yummy, but no complimentary tea or coffee was offered which we though odd.

The only real issue I had is I have a slight fear of flying, so I emailed the airline beforehand, no reply. I told the snotty English man at check-in, wasn’t bothered and the cabin-crew didn’t understand what I was saying. It was a fine fight, but not great if you’re anxious.

The plane, an Airbus A320 Neo, was nice, not a great amount of leg room and it wasn’t the cleanest. But all in all, good.

Pegasus, today, have replied to my initial email, a week late...",1,"2020",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst airline in the world. Damaged my luggage forever, cannot be repaired, and they did not even compensate for it","I am shocked at Pegasus' level of unprofessionalism and lack of ethics. My suitcase was delayed and flown back to me via Pegasus Airlines. It arrived completely damaged. I have filed a claim and asked for compensation. They started coming up with excuses to try and get out of it, saying that my luggage was not delivered to me via Pegasus, as if I am stupid enough not to know that it was. I sent them multiple proofs (including the tag on my suitcase and a report issued by the airport) stating that my luggage was indeed delivered to me via Pegasus. They still refused to assume responsibility and threw it on another airline. I confronted them on multiple occasions with proof, all they did was send me the same answer and not once did they try to collaborate. I sent my suitcase to Samsonite repair center who have confirmed to me that it is so badly damaged that it cannot be fixed anymore. I have lost a perfectly new and limited edition suitcase and got no compensation for it whatsover!!! Pegasus have proven to me that they are unprofessional, unethical, and simply the worst airline ever. Because of this bad experience with them, where they have shown me a total lack of respect and carelessness to a damage that they caused, I do not advise ANYONE to fly Pegasus. They are liars, they do not care about passengers or their concerns, and they do not work on improving their services at all. Shame on them.",1,"2020",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Pegasus ground staff outrageously rude, unhelpful and shout at passenger.","I was on a transfer flight to Izmir via the Sabiha airport (20th Jan around 5:30pm). I stopped by the transfer desk and asked a pegasus staff for direction of the transfer terminal. As he had a very strong accent, I wasn't able to understand what he tried to say, and ended up waking to the wrong direction. When I realised that, I tried to turn back to and was stopped by a security. I tried to explain to him, but as he couldn't speak nor understand english, I tried my best to help him understand the situation but he just kept on pushing me towards the exit. As the place where the security and my was in, was very closed to the transfer counter, I tried my best to asked if he could ask the pegasus staff I just spoke to to explain the situation.

When the pegasus staff walked over, he just immediately shouted at me, asking me what I was doing walking the wrong direction. I tried to explain to him and asked if he could help, as if I have had to leave the exit and check in again the department gate, I would miss my flight. But every time I tried to speak I just got interrupted by him screaming repeatly that it was “your fault, your fault...”. I was absolutely appalled and shocked by such rudeness, therefore, I asked for his name so I could complain, he refused and started walking away while shouting out that I could take a picture of him and call the police.

I had no problem with admitting my limitations that I had missed the signs that directs passengers to transfer terminal (I later realised a lot of passengers also missed it, so maybe there are signage issues). Also I undetand that there are language barriers which might plays apart in this issue. But the way how that pegasus staff treated me was just beyond acceptable. It us not the most helpful experience for passengers when they are abit loss and not familiar with the airport, rushing to transfer.",1,"2020",1

Both of our flights: to and from Istanbul, were without question, excellent. Being a perpetual traveller, I've experienced my fair share of tricky flights, but these flights didn't even venture close. The boarding, at both ends, was calm and measured; the seats were spacious and comfortable; the cost was inexpensive; we arrived on time, and the staff were professional and polite. Pegasus Airline offered me an affordable chance to visit this amazing city, and because of this experience, I will fly with them again to explore more of Istanbul in the near future.",1,"2020",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","I couldn’t leave a 0 star","Flying with Pegasus Airlines was stressful, unorganised and anxiety inducing
The first leg of my outward journey was fine. However, my final leg from Istanbul to Dubai, was delayed by an hour without any explanation
Now, my returning journey, what a completely unorganised circus. Lack of communication between airline and passengers as well as lack of sympathy or assistance when flights were missed or cancelled
The first leg (Dubai to Istanbul) was delayed by over an hour and a half, with no explanation provided by ANY of the airline staff. This then caused me to severely miss the final leg of my return journey (Istanbul to London). But to add insult to injury, the gate number was changed without any announcement, which I am aware caused several people to miss this leg of their journey
Upon arrival in Istanbul, there was no apology from the airline staff. No compensation or even an attempt to alleviate the stress caused
After being transferred onto a new flight and given a food voucher (which none of the airport restaurants would accept), the flight was further delayed by an hour
Finally arriving in London 4 hours later than originally planned, my travel plans home were subsequently missed. The airline has no form of contact to request compensation or to place a complete (suspiciously convenient) so I had to spend further money in order to get home from the airport

The seats don’t go back and there is no pouch to store your personal items, so you have to pretty much hold your personal items the entire time!! On top of all that, they don’t even offer you water without making you paid for it! All they want is your money!! And they take cash on board which seemed kinda shady because they coming back asking passengers to buy items from the menu!!
The flight attendants are super rude and unprofessional!! I was sitting towards the end and kept seeing the flight attendants watching videos on their personal cell phones and laughing at loud about it!! I will NEVER fly with this airline again. It was my first and last flight with them!",1,"2020",1

So they did put me up in a hotel over night, but had to pay 25 euros to get a visa to enter Turkey, was jokingly informed I can claim this back, but the Pegasus website is just as useless as it is at providing flights, and was on hold for 40 mins when trying to phone there help phone number.
I understand it's a budget airline, but the way they treat passengers is a joke, you get zero whilst on board, seats don't recline, I feel they would even charge for life jackets in the result of a crash if the could.
So I'm out almost 2000 uk pounds in total thanks to them, I strongly advise anyone thinking of flying with them to pay more and fly with a more reliable airline, I wouldn't wish the experience I have just had with them on my worst enemy.",1,"2020",1

I reserved the seats for me and my family online and especially for Baby a seat with large legroom. When we were in the airplane there were no large legrooms.. even the seats were so uncomfortable as you sit on a stone. The service was okay but the airplane is too tight and small for so many passengers. At night you want to sleep but you can’t because the light in the airplane is sooo bright you are not able to sleep at all. It wasn’t so clean and you had to drive by bus to get to your airplane never did you entered the airplane from airport always by bus and also when it was raining and so cold with your hand luggage.
I can’t recommend this airplane to anyone.

Everything fine with flight and only detriment compared to THY was smaller seats and paying for your on-board snack. Legroom was fine.
Given the problems emerging with Southern Cyprus and UK's exit from Europe this is a flight I will take again instead of using Limassol which is more onerous and attracts an extra £ 25/- Taxi fare to the North.",1,"2020",4

Due to bad weather conditions all flights were cancelled and the airport closed , understandable ... but why only Pegasus in a whole airport ?? All the other flights were conducted normally and only the company flights were halted due to a nearly deadly accident of a Pegasus pilot ... this of course caused millions of travellers accumulation to non organised grounds and desks asking desperately for a place to overspend their days or nights until the next flight ... mini buses coming to gather us , without even having Space for our luggage .. and in the next morning large people lines for once more with Pegasus staff not even being able to protect and help the ones flying earlier than others .. one Turkish man nearly hit me while I was trying to jump lines as my flight has already been boarding with Pegasus security just looking at us ...

Two children were 12 and that would have counted as adults on Pegasus; but the vendor just asked for the age, not DOB. When we tried to check in online and entered the DOB, they refused to check them in. We spoke to customer care of both the vendor and the airline in a desperate last minute scramble and it was resolved in the end when the two parties spoke to one another - that was a big relief for us. The flight itself was no different from a typical low cost airline - reasonably good but no in-flight entertainment. The menu was limited but not that expensive. The staff were friendly. The flight was slightly delayed; but not massively. Overall ok for a low cost airline!",1,"2020",3

-it's really cheap (i paid around 150€ going and coming back)
-it allows you to bring a pretty big hand luggage + a 20kg luggage, included in the price
-it allows you to travel alone from the age of 14.
ofc it's not the best service ever but consider how cheap this is. i probably wouldn't recommend it for long distances due to the lack of screens and the little space for the legs but for short travels it's really great",1,"2020",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","A nightmare travelling with Pegasus - if you wish to be treated worse than a pig – then 'flypgs'.","'Health' Warning - Do not fly with Pegasus unless you are desperate or need of being humiliated. We had no alternative but to book our flights from Manchester to Istanbul with Pegasus as we tried to look for a 'reasonable' priced flight over the Xmas period, given the Thomas Cook unfortunate situation.

The organisation's logo is very aptly named flypgs (Freudian slip for “fly pigs” that very aptly describes their attitude and treatment of their customers/passengers. All they are after is to maximise on their profit irrespective of the service they provide to their customers, who they treat worse than pigs!!. I believe even pigs are treated better.... This was our first time travelling with Pegasus (described as an “air bus” but even the road buses are a million times better.

The plane is not very comfortable – very little leg room and all they are interested is in packing in as as many people as they can within the limited space available on their planes. The seats are so close together that you can even hear a fellow passenger breathe.

Whatever you do – do not buy the food or drink on board – bring your own or buy it from the airport. The sandwiches (£5 for a roll (and the “meals”£13 each, - were more like a snack - they are very economical with the description in the advert) that make the food look quite a reasonable size and ""tempting"" (when you are hungry). However, when you get it – it is very small and dried up and very unappetising – We doubt even “pigs” would want to eat it. The cokes were £3 and not even the regular size but the slim size cans.

The staff at check out are mean and just there to extract money out of you for even a kilo over 20 kgs, particularly on the Antalya side - when they know they have got you.... The staff (other than just one male steward) on the plane, were 'sour' faced and not very welcoming. When you ask for something (a glass of water), they say they “are busy” and eventually after asking 4 times, they finally brought it after an hour and a half later and then unbelievably wanted to charge for it and this was not even just a short flight.

The plane was dirty and my only regret is that we wish we had taken photographs – there was spilt dried coffee on the seat table tops and around the seats had obviously not been cleaned. When you add up all the extras you end up paying for or to put it another way, what they try and extract from you– you might as well have travelled with a scheduled air line – where you will hopefully be treated like a 'human being'.

It was a nightmare travelling with them (even Easy Jet is marginally better) and a very sad finish to a great holiday. We reiterate, if you wish to be treated worse than a pig – then 'flypgs'.",1,"2020",1

Starting from seats, to the captain door, to the horrible restrooms all carry very bad cleaning habits and ignorance to the basics of human needs. I don’t know what hell will cost them if they clean thier own assets.

Besides, I have never witnessed any airline throwing the baby trolleys under the rain and ask passengers to collect them. How really sad and funny at the same time.

I was on my way home to Jeddah when the Pegasus staff were asking all the documents that I have (Passport, resident ID, exit re-entry, airline tickets, etc.), well I understand that it’s a protocol to do, however, one thing they've ask us that we aren't able to provide... we were asked do online check in with flynas.com (connecting flight in Istanbul to Jeddah) it was 3am and the online check-in for flynas will open 3hrs before flight (our flight is at 15:40... there's no way we can do that (tried to call flynas and that’s what they’ve advised as well) Also since I booked my ticket with trip.com, they tried to help us with the best that they can, they were calling flynas as well but to no avail, finally the contact center agent from trip.com wanted to call my mobile no. so that they can speak with the Pegasus airline agents (but call didn’t went thru as my no. is Saudi registered)... The Pegasus airlines had a very different type of customer service orientation, we were like crazy running back and forth to their booth back to the counter and were asking their help but they were unwilling to do so. I have lost both my tickets from Tbilisi - Istanbul and Istanbul - Jeddah because of only we were unable to do the online check-in from other airlines which opens 3hrs before flight time. Overall it was a terrible experience for me and my friend and had to buy new tickets from Flydubai to get back to Jeddah. The psychological impact happened to us can never be forgotten!",12,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Terrible flight","Leg room is absolutely a joke. My knees touching the seat in front, very painful. I would not recommend this for anyone over 6ft.",12,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Cheap flight to Germany and back","We had 2 flights to Germany with a connection in Istambul.
It was fine. the crew was nice and helpful.",12,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Terrible service horrible customer treatment","People are tricked into paying extra for their luggage before checking in and right before getting in the plane. I felt like being robbed by a very money-grabbing airline that will go as far as forbidding you to get in a plane just because you offered a fellow-traveller to carry their hand lugage or to take some of their luggage because you dont have any and they would otherwise have to pay extra.
Pegasus divides every customer into a single individual they can exploite individually. You cant say you dont need much lugage but your granny or baby does. Granny and baby will need to pay extra. Very absurd money-extracting policies. Pegasus presents itself as a family but no one else can form a family: every customer is an individual some kind of gold-laying chicken. I saw customers in panic opening and redividing their luggage just before we got into the plane. I felt terrible for my fellow-travellers experiencing a lot of stress because of Pegasus' policies and I felt even more terrible to see a so-called Turkish airline company treat people like this. I was ashamed to be a Turkish citizen right then.
By the way: the flight wasnt cheap: more then 350 euros to and from Belgium Charleroi to Istanbul Sabiha Gökçen airport.",12,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","I got what I paid for - and am satisfied","I read a number of reviews of Pegasus Airlines which were mixed to say the least. However, their price for London to Istanbul was unbeatable, and I also flew an additional leg from Erbil to Istanbul.

My main concern was that flights may not run on time - given reviews claiming that they never leave on time. As I was making various connections - including a Turkish Airlines flight to Mardin and a coach journey, I left loads of time. However, every single one of my Pegasus Airlines flights left on time.

As others have noted, you pay for everything on Pegasus Airlines, even water. None of my flights were long, so in most cases I just made sure that I was fed and watered before boarding - and in one case I just had to stump up 20 Turkish Lira for a can of cola.

The seat pitch was quite tight. I'm about 5'10"", and I wonder how anyone taller than me would fit.

Staff weren't as friendly as the Turkish Airlines flight, but they did their jobs. On one of the flights the seats didn't recline. Which isn't a problem for me, as I don't tend to recline much and more often end up suffering through others reclining than benefitting.

In-flight entertainment is also paid, and I believe you must use your own devices.

I've rated them 4*. This is taking into account the low price. I don't expect fantastic service for the prices that Pegasus are charging. I think the staff could have been a bit more friendly, so not 5*.

On the way out I paid to sit in an exit row, and the additional legroom was appreciated. Given the initial price of the ticket, the extra money for the extra legroom still gave a reasonable ticket price.

In SAW, our gate was changed half-way through boarding. I don't know if this was the airline's fault or the airport's fault.

I didn't notice any cleanliness problems with the planes.

Overall, I will definitely choose Pegasus Airlines as my first choice going to Istanbul. They got me where I wanted to go on time, and are cheap.",12,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Terrible service","Very unfriendly and rude staff which did not accommodate any of my questions. I was stuck in queue for 15 minutes and the best they could say was check in at the airport I can't help bye.",12,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","It’s what you’d expect for the money","Getting away from Doha remains not an easy and cheap task, so in trying to save a few pennies, my wife and I chose to go from Doha, via Istanbul to Manchester.

The late night flight to Istanbul was pretty full and consequently left a tight cabin. Not a huge amount of room, sadly - which is why the flight is cheaper.

But ... if you usually sleep at night on a flight and don’t require feeding - this is a cost effective option. I’m 6 foot, so I was a little stiff on arrival - but £200 better off.

What’s more important?",12,"2019",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Nice flight","This is the first international flight with Pegasus beceause of new Turkish İstanbul Airport is very far away from my house. Therefore I picked to Pegasus.

"Pegasus-Airlines","simple cheap","good value for the money, the istanbul terminal was super crowded, flight was on time , didnt order any food or beveages",12,"2019",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Check in issues","Don't bother on line check in if ur in Izmir! Especially if ur hotel’s wifi is poor like the Ladonia! We actually went into town in a internet place to do our on line check in! Didn't make any difference for a speedy process in airport! In fact our line went even slower than those who haven't done on line checkin. On line check in also only open 1 week before the flight!
We bought extra luggage in advance. Our luggage was 2 kgs over 25kgs. We had to unload 2 kgs on to our hand luggage for it to go thru! What a palava over 2 kgs when we paid extra for 5 kgs weight!
Airline stewards not friendly. Will avoid flying with them in future.",12,"2019",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Delays should be their motto","Delays for no obvious reason, no courtesy to let passengers know that their was delayed. Ground staff just come up with vague nonesense answers.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Impressive service and smooth flight","Last minute plan to go to Geneva to catch up with my sister and the ticket prices are so high due to the coming long weekend in Dubai. Thanks to Pegasus Airline for always offering the best price that gives us the opportunity to travel. The check in process from Terminal 2 was smooth and the flight from Dubai left on time. The flight staff were helpful and attended to passengers politely. Am super impressed. The flight deck gives update from time to time.
I will definitely fly with them again.",12,"2019",5

Flight Details
AMS-INSTAMBUL-ABUDHABI-pegasus airline
PNR: GLWS7A
Date: 14th Dec
Baggage Identification Number: PC 711111

When i arrived at abu dhabi airport i found my luggage is missing but
Due to transit rules i wasn't able to file a PIR at the airport. Then i tried to contact the help desk number but all numbers listed on website are dysfunctional. even on Email you didn't get the response. The airport authorities didn't have their numbers. I am still struggling to get my luggage and lost all my hope.",12,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","DISGUSTING AIRLINE. DO NOT USE PLEASE","The IT systems are terrible, so I can't check in online using English. Terrible. I arrived at the Istanbul Sabiha airport Pegasus check in to see that the ""express self check in"" kiosks were terrible. When I scanned my passport, it presented me with another booking that was similar to mine. Their entire IT infrastructure is terrible.

THE AIRPORT STAFF WERE HORRIBLE.. I asked them to help me, showing them that the express check in was faulty. They told me to go one place after another. NO ONE HELPED ME. I missed my flight because they told me to go to a new place everytime, to get rid of me and in order to now help me. Staff were so rude and did not help.

After waiting for so long, and the failure of their self check in, I decided to go to the normal check inline, this que was so long. Only 5 desks and a line that is so long that it takes more than an hour of waiting to finally do a check in and baggage drop.

Ryanair and easyjet are like Qatar Airways business class compared to Pegasus.

Please do not use this airline. You will regret it. Worst staff ever. Worst leg room. Worst service. Disgusing service.",12,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","A “Close Shave” in an indirect flight by pagasus","I booked a two way trip from Pegasus to fly from Izmir to Tehran with an exchange in the “SAW” International Airport in Istanbul. The flight itself was fantastic, but a little delay in boarding process in Izmir was so stressful for me that I thought I am going to lose the 2nd plane of this indirect trip. I was so lucky that my 110 minute stop in the “SAW” airport was enough to pass the gigantic queue of passport control, and board in the very last minutes! It was literally a close shave, and I shall hereby thank Pegasus for the professional and caring staff and cabin crew.
At last I shall add that scheduling better flights (specifically the indirect ones) may definitely be very difficult & related to many factors (including the airport busyness), but it won’t be impossible.",12,"2019",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Terrible flight with extremely uncomfortable seats and service","The flight was very low quality in terms of service and the plane used was super old with old school-bus style seats. Most of us had hard time recovering from the soreness and backache after our flights.",12,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Fair prices and service fine","We flew from Berlin to Muscat with a stopover in Istanbul. Everything was OK. On the return flight there was a bit of trouble with the weight of the main baggage. For 4 people, we were calculated to be 3 kg overweight. We had to remove the 3 kg from our 4 luggages and repack to our cabin bags. It took a while and all in all it's so silly that the 3 kg flew in cabin bags instead of in the main luggage. In addition, everything was kind and nice.",12,"2019",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Pegasus website and customer service experience","I have used Pegasus airlines before and the quality has been good for an affordable price and I liked it.

Recently I tried to change a flight and the Pegasus website informed me that the new flight has only 8 kg baggage allowance.

I had been paid for 20 kg second piece of baggage for the first flight. So I contacted Pegasus call center. I was connected to an operator in no time and the operator told me that any purchased baggage from my previous flight will be transferred to my new flight automatically.

I wish they add this information to the flight change page to have a better website. In addition Pegasus sends email in Turkish for International customers which I like to receive them in English as well.",12,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","PEGASUS AIRLINES","I took four flights on Pegasus Airlines within a month. All flights were good. The Cabin Crew were excellent. On the last flight we took off a bit late but landed at Stansted Airport on time. The leg room is not too bad but the seats I found a bit narrow. The in flight food menu is on the expensive side. For the price you pay on this airline the service is very good and the staff are very polite. I would be happy to use the airline again.",12,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Really good budget airline","A good budget airline still offering 2 pieces of cabin luggage in their basic price. Allowance is 8kgs in cabin bag and a smaller bag of 5kgs. It is less rigid than RyanAir and a lot more relaxed, plus flights were very cheap.",12,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Stingy and unfriendly","We payed a lot of money for that flight to not even get a glass water for free, it doesn’t cost anything to give a passenger a glass of water for free , it’s a shame..
There was as well a women who suffered an asthma attack, she unfortunately forgot her asthma spray, the response of the cabin crew (a girl with short red hair) was : and why did she forget it? come on, the person will probably pass out and instead of taking a quick action you are asking a stupid question which did not make the situation any better.
Seats were quite hard but leg space was ok , flight was punctual.",12,"2019",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Nice flight with short connexion","Nice flight in general with short connection, relaxing seat, with acceptable legroom.
the staff was nice, and it was easy to have a nap",12,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","moderate flight","This is a moderate flight. The seats are not wide enough. The airplane itself is good, departure and arrival was on time. Flying was well and did not shake much during the flight. Food and drinks were paid during the flight, and very expensive: Cola: 2.5 euros
samll sandwich: 8-10 euros.
entertainment was paid
Luggage for 20 Kg, and a small 8 Kg handbag was allowed",12,"2019",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Free drink, please!","The flight itself was as good as can be, however, absolutely ridiculous prices for such a basic necessity called water.

You need a small mortgage for most items they sell onboard, such a shame they have to charge, but guess they're trying to make an even bigger profit from their loyal customers...",12,"2019",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Pick Pegasus","Choices of seat, food, baggage, entertainment can be added to your basic price. If on a budget and don't want to eat and have olnly hand luggage - then you can't get cheaper than this. Good time keeping, good transit in Istanbul, . They never lose luggage! and for the disabled, assistance is ready and reliable.",12,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","pegasus airlines","if you're looking for budget travel, look no more, for destinations around Europe and middle east. reliable and punctual.

"Pegasus-Airlines","From Istanbul to Konya by Pegasus Airlines","The price performance ratio for flights was quite good. Both flights took off in time. Meals and in-flight entertainment are offered for a fee. Overall I enjoyed it.",12,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Value for money","Easy to book, reasonable price, on-time departure, easy check-in, cabin size allowance.
It is low cost airline but it is not as greedy as other low cost airlines. You are still treated as a valuable customer not a ""low budget customer"".",12,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","flight in time, friendly staff","the price was very good, so i get a good service for the price i pay. the stuff was friendly and efficient",12,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","A showcase for budget airlines","I fly quite extensively during the year for business and this time having had a short time to book my flight the agency that works for my company choose Pegasus Airlines since all other flights were already booked.

Pegasus is the epitome of budget airlines, crampy spaces, smaller than usual and broken seats and overprices snacks/drinks on board. I had the fortune to change my seat to an exit row where I had to switch three different seats as two of them were already broken.

First leg of the flight was ok since it was just 1.5 hours but the 2nd leg of 4 hours+ was one of the worst possible flights I have experienced. The plane was full and in the small seats with virtually no legroom, one could as well get real cramps in the legs. Same story went on for the return flight as well.

To put the cherry on the cake there were delays on both outwards and inbound flights and in the special airport of Istanbul Sabiha Gokcen (where Pegasus Airlines operates) there is next to nothing to do. The transit area is the size of a shoebox, quite dirty and the fastfood chains that operate are some of the worst I have seen so far.

Attendants on the ground and flight personnel are really nice and one might feel sorry that their efforts are wasted.

I would fly it again only as a last resort and definitely only for short-haul flights.",12,"2019",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","excellent flight.","a good economical airlines, on time flight , services were good enough ,ticket fair was excellent, i loved the take off and landing in this kind of airport in Trabzon, interesting among the sea.",12,"2019",4

"Pegasus-Airlines","Turkry’s answer to EasyJet","Very happy to recommend Pegasus. Although using UK to Turkey route, the Pegasus network is extensive. A budget airline similar to EasyJet’s operation. Punctual. Efficient check-in. Good cabin crew. Choice of timings on London to Turkey routes and at better times than UK operators albeit not direct flights. But now of the view that it is more sensible to take extra time on a day flight than going directly at some unearthly hour.",12,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Great Staff, Great Service. Would Definitely Recommend.","We flew from London Stansted to Izmir with Pegasus. Check in was simple, quick and efficient. The same can be said for boarding too. The aeroplane was clean and tidy, with polite, friendly and helpful air hostesses. The snack was tasty, and more than enough for the 3 hour flight. There is no in flight entertainment on some planes, and a very limited choice for duty free, however this is far from a major issue.",12,"2019",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Same as all low cost airlines","Very Sad and Not kind flight attendants, Not nice and hardly answer questions, Inefficient and nimble",12,"2019",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Will never fly again","I wait here an hour past the time the flight should have take off — ONE HOUR and not even an announcement that the flight is delayed, so now I get to miss my connecting flight after an all night flight and being up for over 24 hours. Will I have to stay up for a full 36 now? I can’t wait to see. I hope this trash airline goes out of business",12,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Low cost, optimal service","Flight was plesant there was a delay but not noticiable at all.
But when we were flying back, the airline agent on check in desk abandoned us seeing approaching to her. We did our online check-ins but had baggages. Even the flight was delayed and gate was not open till after one hour of this incident.She refused to make our checkins and having the baggages. We run all over the airport with our 5 baggages. Paid overpriced penalties and left our liquids to have our baggages to aircraft. We carried them over 60 stairs. I think this has nothing to do with Pegasus. but the airport staff was not helpful at all.",12,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","First rate service","Due to a delay beyond their control (European Air Space saturated) my flight from Stansted to Istanbul was delayed, therefore I missed my connecting flight to Sharma. Pegasus put me up in a very comfortable Ibis hotel

, provided dinner even though it was after 1am, and full breakfast, lunch and dinner the following day, before sending a driver to pick me up to take me the airport. My ensuing flight was excellent, as was my return journey (All on time).",12,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Flight with Pegasus. Good choice","We may start with this question, why we or I choose Pegasus Airlines? Mostly because it is low-cost. Yes, that is true. Definetely low-cost if we compare the price with other two competitors fly in the same sector. Actually we may not say same sector because Pegasus flies to Sabiha Gokcen Airport but even I live in the European side of the Istanbul, I choosed Pegasus also for this reason because Airport is small, so short taxi time, less flight hours, quick exit from the Terminal Building, because small. If we turn back to beginning, the price was also one of the big reason. But if you pre-order or order meal in the flight, the price can be at last half price comparing with other Airlines. When you check the website, the price looks 1/3 cheaper compared other competitors but include tax, meal and etc.. price getting higher. However still half price and this is very good. Aircraft is new, acceptable delay, good cabin crew, paid pre order meal but was delicious. One big negative thing is seats on aircraft was very uncomfortable. On the Bahrain to Istanbul flight we were on an Airbus A320 with rock hard non-reclining seats. I can accept seats without entertainment and etc.. but Non-reclining seat is really uncomfortable and just imagine, Bahrain-Istanbul flight is one of the longest sector and can say middle-range flight and you can’t sleep. I guess reasons for non-reclining seats for more space when you sit (not just because of your front seat is not laying dawn, also seat is thinner than normal seats). That is one of the reason and I guess main reason is, these seats can be cheaper than normal seats and most probably Pegasus Airlines choosed these seats when they order these aircrafts from Airbus. To be honest, for Pegasus Airlines perspective they are absolutely right. If you wanna fly with less money, something may different. As I was comparing the price in the beginng, if you wanna pay half or even less, why not? just don’t sleep and read something and you will not loose so much things in four hours from your life. But if you like your comfortable too much, pay double or even more and fly with others. This is of course also good and sometimes we do, that is normal. If you ask me, I wanna pay less again and can spend this difference for myself with this saved money. Do I wanna fly with Pegasus. I guess why not? New, cleaned aircraft, more space between seats, smiley crew, comfortable flight, delicious meal, quick turn around, planned flight time. It was my first experience and
4 stars just because non-reclining seats that is all.
Rest of very good. I recommended.",12,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","An ""OK"" flight experience ... not more.","The airline uses Air Bus 320 planes. Seats are very dense, you always touch the shoulders of the one seating next to you. No multimedia / flight entertainment at all. Seats are no reclining at all - only a straight position. From schedule position, on the outbound flight there was a fault in the plane - so this incurred a 1 hour delay, other than that - schedule was OK. Staff was friendly and good.
Flight was completely full, on both ways - no free seat, and heavily loaded with cabin baggage. No food served on the flight unless you pay for it on-board.",12,"2019",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Good flight, no issues","Flew with Pegasus for a recent return trip to Istanbul. Both flights were on time, service on board was good and it was a overall comfortable flight. I would use again.",12,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Low cost airline with low expectations. Similar to Ryanair.","It is just another low cost airline. They have yet to find a way of standing out, but so far they have not. I was lucky enough to have a smooth flight.",12,"2019",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Good budget company","You can compare it to Ryanair only the staff is much more friendly. No problems both ways. The fleet is good for a maximum 3 hour flight. The legs pace is too small for long flights",12,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Pegasus great airline","Used pegasus for the first time in September from Manchester to dalaman and I would honestly recommend them, great friendly staff,helpful staff, no entertainment on board but you can pay to use music and films on your phone via an app also on the app you can log on and see where your traveling over ect, great flight and cheap would deffo use again",12,"2019",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Would recommend, new quiet fleet, I will use again","I flew via Istanbul so two flights with them. Both planes were brand new neo versions and I have never been on such a quiet smooth plane. I had extra leg room which was very comfortable new leather seating. The crew were lovely and the inflight entertainment at a very low cost a nice option. Also believe it or not the hot food was very tasty. I will use them again for sure",12,"2019",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","İt is a good airline with new jets but very uncomfortable and narrow seats","İt is a convenient airline for a fact but seats are very narrow and you almost pay for the air you breath....",12,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Great Value","Good value for a budget airline, friendly staff and easy booking in procedure. Waiting time on return trip took a little longer but I believe that was to do more with ground crew issues not the airline.",12,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","The worst airline i've ever been to","No water no pillow no blanket no drinks and food. almost a prison in north korea. I think the space between the sits were designed to suit midgets.",12,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Effective","Pegasus is not the airlines that I use mostly because of the seating ares are too small but I can say that if you compare with price that they provide is effective",12,"2019",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Budget Airline,Budget price","I paid extra for food, extra luggage and in flight entertainment . The entertainment was some kind of link so you can watch on your mobile phone- it didn’t work for me!

"Pegasus-Airlines","best low cost option","I prefer Pegasus due to the comfort of Sabiha airport and also the price. I can always find cheap prices together with a good flight experience. Mostly on time, and also better airport options in Europe also. I am content of the cabin people and seat comfort. If I fly in the afternoonI preorder my food which is from high quality DOCO company",12,"2019",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","No frills...you get what you pay for but it's cheaper than the competition","If you wanna save a few bucks and don't care to have ANY free service (I mean nothing...not even water is free), then Pegasus will get you there cheap. We opted to pay slightly more and pay for a bag and seat choice for each of our 4 passengers which came with a tasty sandwich as part of the package. I wasn't prepared that they wouldn't have a free drink service like most commercial airlines. You had to pay for everything even water...bring your own it's much cheaper! Seats were comparable to the competition and we were lucky that it wasn't a full flight so we even got an open seat next to us. Overall, wasn't bad but next time I'll bring my own water.",12,"2019",4

"Pegasus-Airlines","My Experience with Pegasus Airlines","Summary of my horrible experience with this airline, which I will NEVER use again.

X Unboarded me off the flight with very little explanation and no clarification, carrying an attitude of ‘I do not have to explain myself to you’.

X Embarrassed my partner and I as Madelan shouted at me infront of other passengers on the plane and muttered racist insults comparing my partner and I to ‘black monkeys’ in the Dutch language

X Failed to get any medical assistance when I was unboarded (despite my repeated requests), after claiming this was the reason she was unboarding me

X Sent me to T4 (to re-book the next flight) which is absurd if she thought I was 'unfit' to fly

X Dealt with the situation in an unprofessional manner by speaking to me in a rude, aggressive, embarrassing and dismissive manner

X Informed me that there was no point in complaining as the staff’s account will outweigh any passenger statements -which I thought was completely unprofessional

X Failed to unload my luggage onto the next flight, which resulted in my partner and I being sent to another country without any essentials for over 40 hours",12,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","No water for 5 Hrs flight","We know that we have paid less comparatively but not that less where this airline can't serve/afford a glass of water for 5 hrs. flight. the creamed legroom and hard sitting will punish you for your compromises. but if you are looking a budget can fly considering only travel and carry your water/food with you and enjoy in a group.",12,"2019",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","A NORMAL LOW COST AIRLINE","Nothing to brag about but then considering the Airline to be a low cost one service is very good. The ground staff & in flight crew are also good & professional. Since we had prepaid online for excess baggage the airline offered a sandwich with the excess baggage as any food requested inflight is charged for extra. This was a cold sandwich which was simply terrible although the coffee we paid for inflight was good. All said & done, for a cheap, low cost airline the service, planes & inflight leg room is good.

This is the only company I suffered so bad service from stansted airport. Thanks god ... I’m the only Chinese there compared other passengers are either British or Turkish. So I been treated as from third countries or the only person the stuff can use her power trip to me. Great ! ! !",12,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Suffer a lady’s power trip badly","It is okey when I be noticed need book all hotels during the trip. When I said it’s rasict, the lady works there said it’s normal, we check for countries like African also. I was trying to book hotel beside far from the desk, but she kept To follow us and asked to go further further. When I booked hotels and back to the desk, they asked to check my passport, e-visa and return ticket again.then she threatened to call the police because I started crying. What kind of company makes their customers feel like this and how is it okay for Pegasus staff to have power trips. I have never suffered this type of service and I travel regularly everywhere around the world. I traveled to new York and around America twice but never suffered this type of abuse. They ruined the very begin of our journey. I will not be flying with Pegasus again in future and I will not hold my grand trip across Europe with this company, not spend any money here anymore.",12,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst Airlines","In my 42 years of air travel I testify that Pegasus airlines is the worst ever. With crumbled seats almost touching nose by the front seat and thin non cushioned seats the flight is a misery. Although classified as low cost carrier i paid a price which is no less than other airlines. The cabin is filled up with seats and even the toilet space is utilized for seats and one single toilet is pushed on the back. Staff has no courtesy no service no politeness just engaging in selling drinks and snacks for prices 10-30 times higher than regular price. In the mid of a night flight when they feel they did not sell enough they switch on the lights and push the lousy trolley to sell in prices of shylock’s pattern.",12,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Such a bad company.they destroy my vacation","They lost my luggage and after 2 days I send lot of emails no one replay only the venice airport. When finilly they find it they not want bring it to me to my home.i stay 2 days without any clothes, very bad experience",12,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","cheap easy flight","cheap easy flight ... leg room limited in economy and if you have a flypgs account they will not give you the seat selection you preference so if you want a window or an aisle be prepared to pay for it as an extra..",12,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worse Plane Ever","The seats are literally 90 degrees i usually fall asleep easily but even i couldn't do it with such a straight back it was one of the worse flights i have even experienced, and the ticket wasn't cheap at all. I will not be flying with them again.",12,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Chaos","If I were anything to do with this poor excuse for an airline I would be ashamed. Can’t check in online at all - because they need to do a document check at the desk. Result? A queue the length of the terminal to check in. Rude, careless ground staff who told me - you can’t check in online and we can’t give you exit row seats because “computer says no”. Delayed by over an hour but promised that my connection flight in Istanbul will not leave without waiting for this one. Absolute lie. Got to the transfer desk which was chaos and was told I was in the next flight in 4 hours. Oh, but it’s ok - here’s a Burger King voucher. Wow. If you haven’t flown with Pegasus, don’t. Tiny seats that no longer recline so they can squeeze in a couple more rows. No refreshments at all. Not even a glass of water. I will NEVER use this airline again. What an embarrassment. They make Ryan Air look first class.",11,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","It was a routine flight experience","It was a usual flight and I have no complaints. At the ticket counter in Istanbul, the agent told me that he had assigned me a seat with extra leg room for no extra charge. So it was a window seat in front of one of the emergency doors.",11,"2019",4

We will choose Pegasus again with pleasure.",11,"2019",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Good company","After reading a lot of negatives references about this company, I have to admit that I was scared before the flight.
This was my first time traveling with Pegasus, and my experience has been pretty good: 4 flights on time, good coordination, good cabin crew (very friendly), good planes(new and clean) and they didn’t check the bagagges (nothing at all. A lot of people had big hand bagagges).
So, for that price and the service and quality they have, I think is a good company to flight with.
Highly recommended",11,"2019",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","budget carrier","First time with Pegasus. Definitely a budget airline (in Europe), slots in between Ryanair and Easyjet. Legroom was awful for 1.84 male. Toilets not nice. Didn't try food or drink. Staff fine.",11,"2019",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Meh...","Skipper shut the doors at Stansted a half hour before flight. No aircon, so we were overheating right from the get go. Things didn't change. Airbus A320. Initial announcements were in dual languages, but later, the skipper was only talking Turkish, so seemingly didn't give a toss for his non Turkish customers. No in flight sales outward bound, but there was on return. Cabin crew delightful & friendly. Aircraft clean, but tight on space (I'm 5'10""), 3.5 hours was a ball breaker. Literally. Gokcen a good, modern airport, no wifi, though. Beer available. Also is the first place I've seen with an official ""weapons deposit"" area...!",11,"2019",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Horrible","This was my first time to experience such a horrible flight.
First i thought it may be my seat 4a, has faulty recline mechanism.
Then i discover no button & finally realised the whole aircraft was without recline seat mechanism in order to accommodate extra seats.
Not a single KG extra weight is allowed.
Unless one have an utter emergency, this flight cant be recommended at all due to its horrible comfort level.",11,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","London Stansted to Adana Airport (with Istanbul SAW stopover)","I'm not one to usually write reviews but I spent days researching for my trip I have just been on and I figure this could be a slight stress reliever for some people (as this would of helped me out if I knew this information beforehand). I could never find the right answers for what I needed so I will go thoroughly through my process and hopefully it may help!

First of all, I had extremely low expectations for Pegasus Airlines. After reading all the bad reviews online, I started to panic slightly but thankfully I had no problems. Maybe I just got lucky but I wouldn't say Pegasus was a terrible airline, yes it is a budget airline so you shouldn't expect first class service but the flight attendants and staff I came across were very pleasant. Now I had two flights for day one of my trip. I travelled from Stansted to Adana via Istanbul Sabiha Gökçen.

I had 1 hour and 30 minutes stopover in Istanbul. Now I was nervous at the stopover time as a lot of people had said it wasn't enough time for me to get through and get onto my second plane, however I managed to do it like a champ! My first plane actually ended up being delayed by 40 minutes so as you can imagine I was extremely nervous about getting through. Once we had landed we had to get on a bus to the terminal (which was extremely annoying). I then had to go through passport/visa control which was very time consuming as it was extremely busy. After going through visa control, you have to go past baggage control and out of the exit. Now thankfully Sabiha Gökçen airport has both the international and domestic terminal all in the same building. So once you exit out of the international terminal, head straight upstairs and go through security for the domestic departures.

After rushing and going through domestic security I managed to find my gate and board my final plane just on time! When reaching Adana airport however, you go into their domestic terminal. Now my luggage had been transferred straight through from Stansted which thankfully saved me time on my stopover, but I didn't realise it would go to Adana airports international terminal. So if anybody on here is doing the same or similar trip to me, when you go into the domestic terminal make sure you tell the staff you've come from an international airport as your luggage will be in their terminal! If I'm honest the staff there didn't speak English, so I used what Turkish I knew and they helped me get to the right place for my bag. So all in all it was a pleasant journey there.

Now Adana airport is very small, the staff don't speak English however all signs are in English so if you don't speak any Turkish then you can use them for the majority of your trip. Although saying that, the staff I came across were friendly enough and weren't rude like a lot of people have said in previous reviews. Again I might of just got lucky that day but I've had no issues.

The trip back was a lot smoother as I had more of a knowledge of what to expect. So my trip back through Istanbul was similar to my arrival. Coming from Adana I arrived into Istanbuls domestic arrival area so I walked straight through and again went through the exit and back upstairs to the main terminal. This was when I had to go through passport control and then security to the international departures. After that I found my gate and waited for my final flight back home! I had preordered a meal on the way back, the food was basic but enough to get me through the journey. Again the flight attendants were more than happy to help anyone and they did speak and have a good knowledge of English, as also the flight instructions/messages were spoken in both Turkish and English. There was an option for in-flight entertainment however you had to pay for it so I can't rate that one. I just use downloaded films from Netflix and listen to music :) Hopefully this helps!",11,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Competitive Prices for Turkish Flights","Pegasus Airlines is a budget no-frill carrier. It is what you have paid for--to simply fly. As a mid sized asian, the legroom is ample with very comfortable seat width. As with many low cost carriers, the flight turnover is very high, as such cabin crews fly several legs each shifts. This fatigue does show on their faces even if they tried being friendly. Food, drinks, and in-flight entertainment come as an additional cost and expectedly costly. Online facilities worked seamlessly for me from booking to checking in to appearing at the gates with a mobile barcode.",11,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Not Recommended","Trouble start from check in with that lady name Cr.... start trouble for some issue for return ticket and inform me to wait for 10 minutes for Pegasus Airline in charge to solve issue, after always that lady told me wait 10 , 10, wasting time no body come .after she told her Manager he will come and also not come .Any how after 1 hour i booked return ticket for finish this story. Plane seat too small no pocket on the front seat, No USB socket to charge Mobile , Seat back cant flip.
AC is Not working too hot . NOT Recommended to fly with Pegasus.",11,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","From Istanbul to Egypt","Terrible way for check in online. We had big problem with check in our luggage in Egypt. The website doesn’t work for hours. Finally we did it but whole day we should spoke with the support, with the airport, with some other company. My last day in Egypt was ruined because of this.",11,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Not the best","No friendliness, very expensive food, but so not good, very expensive drinks, old airplane, they check the weight of the hand luggage right before boarding",11,"2019",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst customer attendee","Me and my husband lost the plane because there was a big delay for us at the passport check in and also the police control lines. Even though we managed to arrive at the gate when the last bus was there they just said we cannot let you in cause is 1 minute past. I asked them if there was anything we could do because our baby was waiting us home they just said no and when asked what should we do now, their answer was go and buy another ticket :((((",11,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Unusual economy flight","No screening procedure on boarding the plane. The man next to me was not in his assigned seat and his friend kept reassuring him that he would be fine.
I had prepaid for a meal and it was not given to me until I asked for it later in the flight.",11,"2019",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Horrible airline service","They dont provide meals with the fare u paid even for the international flights which is one of a kind horridness, not even a free glass of water.. the online booking doesnt clearly specified the meal should be paid separately.. it just give u the option meal preference which from all the other airlines means any specification on the food u want to have. They also load more cabbin carry ons than what seems safe.. cabin crew are ao rigid and has no sympathy with the passengers. I hope not to have to board this plane again.. and do not recommend it. U paid too much for what u got.",11,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","If you have high blood pressure or heart problems please DO NOT contact PEGASUS.","I had a reservation for the 19:50 flight on Wednesday evening. Because of some problems I noticed that I may be too late for the flight and wanted to change my reservation to the 22:05 flight.
The internet site did not allow me to do it online although Pegasus keep advertising as a digital airline.
I had to call the call center. After waiting for 22 minutes for the available person to answer (on roaming) I was told that they cannot do it because I had purchased the ticket through an agent. They gave me another call center number to call.
After again waiting for some 15 minutes on roaming I managed to talk to a lady who tried her best to help. ı was asked to pay some amount (almost new ticket prices) and I agreed. We tried FİVE different credit cards from THREE different banks and ALL had errors. Not possible to pay.
The lady asked me to call again after ten minutes and maybe the system stabilizes.
As I was desperate I called again and waited for 33 minutes on roaming to get through again. The result was the same.
I had to send someone in person to the agent Wednesday morning to do the changes which resulted in a price increase.
The question is:
Why can't I do it online?
Why would the system not accept credit cards? (All checked thru the banks and OK)
Why would the first call center could not do the job?",11,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Poor quality","I had a terrible experience with Pegasus flight from Dubai to Istanbul. First of all the leg room is so cramped. Secondly, there was no pocket on the front seat!!! Which I assume they don't want people to bring their own snack as their service is not free!! It is not like Turkish airline or Emirates airline and so on that they serve you food and water without being charged. Yes I know it might be the reason to be a little bit cheaper than other flight but on the other hand they offer a terrible facilities as mentioned above. I surely won't consider to travel with Pegasus any more unless they improve themselves and respect passengers. To make more money, making more rows of seats and less room legs and no pockets in front of passengers is a totally disrespectful and not acceptable.",11,"2019",2

"Pegasus-Airlines","Great Value - Quick fast and minimalist","Its rather well organised to book and get your journey underway.
They seem to always change the flight times by 10-15 minutes for some reason, not that it makes a great difference because you are there 2 hours before the flight to check in anyhow. good choice of ""quick foods"" and drinks as well as swift payment methods although I feel they should disallow cash payments because of the delays it causes, so they should incentivize the card payers by offering a slight discount really.",11,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Affordable and Smooth flight","Pegasus Airline was a very good airline. Very affordable and provides you what you pay for. Not in a bad way but in a good way. Flight was on time. Im planing to take the same airline going to Spain! Hope to see you soon Pegasus!",11,"2019",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Happy to fly with them again and again","We travelled with Pegasus to Istanbul then Manchester following the collapse of Thomas cook.

"Pegasus-Airlines","A nightmare ! Never take again","When I arrived in Istanbul airport, I shocked to find my luggage completely destroyed !! and I didn't find my Watch, stolen by Pegasus staff.
I went to see Pegasus office, the communicaton was very diffcult, they didin't speak any other langage except their own langage the turkish.
I contact the client service, they offer me damage of 10€ while I bought my luggage 350€.
THis compagny is the worst I saw in my life !! Turkish staff is impolite and rude.",11,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Never fly with pegasus","I flew with Pegasus twice and I hope I don't have to fly with them anymore. The last flight was from Sabiha to Amsterdam, instead of 7pm the flight left around 10pm and we were just lucky to be able to catch the last train home. The staff are not trained well. Every singlel time they pass in the corridor they hit you. There was an old man sitting behind me with a crane. The stewardess took his crane and placed it in the cabine above our head. Later the moment I opened the cabine to take my bag, the crane fell off so badly it could have hurt someone! Somehow the people who take this flight do not care for others since both flights I could not sleep for a second due to people yelling instead of talking and pushing the chairs with their legs...",11,"2019",1

"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst airline I’ve ever experienced","Pegasus Airlines - has the most appalling service I’ve ever received. The check in attendant was so rude and aggressive.
After I asked for the cost of adding an extra bag and expressed my shock, the attendant decided to respond to me by raising his voice. Then continued his aggressive manner by standing up while still raising his voice. It didn’t help that his 6 foot stature overshadowed my 5’1 physique. This then lead to me breaking down in tears which didn’t stop his aggression but just fuelled it. I’ve never been spoken to in such manner and am disgusted that the airline would allow such service. I hope no one ever books with this appalling excuse of an airline.

Check in attendant was called Ben and is in the picture posted.",11,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst company ever","Worst company ever, worst staff ever, if you have extra weight they force you to pay and give you no receipt
It's better to pay a little bit more than travelling with them, there is no confort at all, no flight entertainment for a long journey, only 20kilos, they're making saving on everything, and they treat customers very badly.
They won't give you a glass of water of course",11,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","A quiet and pleasant flight","We flew on the Bergamo-Istanbul roundtrip (Sabiha Gokcen Airport, located on the Asian side of Istanbul).

The company used the usual trick: expected flight duration almost 3 hours, real duration just over 2. So, on the way, late departure (30 minutes) but punctual arrival; on the way back, instead, punctual departure and arrival in advance.

As in all medium-range low-cost flights, the ticket does not include food or drinks; the aircraft was clean and of last generation: a Boeing 737-800, in a configuration that maximized the seats, to the detriment of comfort, on the other hand all low cost airlines follow a similar logic.

Friendly staff, although their cknowledge of the English language was approximate. Perfect baggage handling, especially in Istanbul (record delivery times).",11,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","BAD SERVICE, RUDE STAFF, BAD FOOD","will never travel this Turkish airline it offers terrible services starting from their food, language handling, boarding issue, rudeness,etc etc",11,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Cheap and efficient","The flight was efficient as were the cre but it was a bit souless. On the outbound flight too many people were allowed to take cases onto the plane. The people in front of us had their cases under their feet which was dangerous.",11,"2019",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","You pay for every detail","Luggage allowed only 20 kilos, nothing is offered on board for free, not even water. Delay for two hours while sitting in the plane. U wait for the bus to be filled up with passenger before driving you to the arrival terminal, and you risk be late to reach your connection flight. My luggage arrived socked in rain water as well as my stuff and cloth inside",11,"2019",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Best economy airline","Pegasus offered the most convenient combination for our flight from Bucharest to Antalya, with stop in Istanbul.
Check in done easily online, smooth luggage drop off, and same went with the embarkation.
For a comfortable flight, I highly recommend to choose the front raw seats. Also the entertainment system is pretty useful, and meals on board quite delicious.
Staff kind and attentive.
The application itself is easy to use, and upgrading luggage allowance or changing the seats more than affordable.
Recommended!",11,"2019",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Very economical prices compared to Turkish","The ticket price was 1/4th of Turkish Airlines.
You pay for luggage , food on board and seats but we still came ahead.
The service level is not bad at all. We traveled from European side of the city all the way to Sabiha Gokcen Airport to take advantage of the savings.",11,"2019",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Mixed review","The good things:
- The airline offered direct flights to where we wanted to go.
- Both outbound and return flights ran on time.
- Cabin service was efficient (two rounds of the drinks trolley) on both outbound and return flights.
- We had pre-ordered hot meals on the outbound flight, and thought these were excellent in quality and value for money. We ordered Chicken Schnitzel, which was served with little roasted potatoes, a really crisp mixed salad in a separate dish (with a little bottle of dressing), a half-lemon to squeeze over (covered with muslin to stop the pips coming out), a roll and butter and a chocolate mousse dessert.

The not-so-good things:
- The aircraft on the outbound flight (Stansted to Izmir) seemed particularly dirty - crumbs on seat, dirty tray-table, and what looked like trodden-in chewing gum on the floor; although the aircraft on the return flight was a bit cleaner.
- I had pre-ordered a chicken sandwich for the return flight, and was given a chicken tikka sandwich - which, in contrast to the hot meal on the way out, was not nice.
- We were not aware of the flight deck crew making any passenger announcements (in any language) during either flight, so we had no information on routing, weather etc..",11,"2019",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","The best budget flight I've experienced","Punctual, clean aircraft, polite smart staff. No annoying and childish announcements that you have to endure with Jet2, EasyJet or Ryanair, so you can sleep and relax on the flight. Prices reasonable on board, food excellent. So impressed, looking forward to booking again.",11,"2019",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst service ever!","Tried to book a flight for February. Filled in all my personal data, seats, luggage and on the final page I couldn't chose the option pay with credit-card. Contacted the helpdesk, told me to send an email with the problem. And after a week the only option they gave was to book again, but now the prices are increased with a total of more then 100€. They wouldn't do anything to give me my original price! They just wanted to earn more money and ripp people of! It's unfair that I need to pay more due their booking problems!",11,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Brilliant!","Was booked with Thomas Cook. Tried to find a replacement flight but our lovely British Airlines were just ripping people off. Despite all the bad reviews for Pegasus we decided to take a chance. We were not disappointed, quite the opposite. They were very helpful with our booking. The flight was Manchester to Dalaman - Direct and return. Booked Business flex which gave us extra leg room, choose your seat 20kg of hold luggage and 12kg of hand luggage each. The flights were very comfortable and almost on time. The staff were very attentive and extremely friendly. The cost was much less than the greedy British Airlines. Would definitely book with Pegasus again. Thank you.",11,"2019",5

I paid 60$a suitcase (!!) for 2 hours flight . Do yourself a favor and Pay 30$ more and u can fly in a normal reliable airline that let u take a suitcase , giving u meal, nice to you . I begged for a glass of water because I wasn’t feeling good and the flight attendant just ignored me twice as we flying for free.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Return trip to UK from Turkey","Following the recent unjust airfare price increases to and from Turkey, I was forced to look at alternatives for inbound and outbound. Used Liverpool airport and EasyJet for direct flight to Dalaman and Pegasus Airlines using the Dalaman, Istanbul, Manchester route. Lay over was 1 hour 30 mins at Istanbul.Checked in baggage was to the destination. Secured 2 business flex tickets at a very reasonable rate.Joined their rewards programme to benefit from future reductions. Will definitely be using Pegasus again, either direct or connecting.",11,"2019",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","More than happy","At 280 for 2 adults which includes 3 nights in Istanbul, how can anyone complain. The flight from Manchester to Istanbul was bang on time. Yes the plane could have done with a bit of a spruce up and clean, but the efficiency of the staff more than made up for it. We also paid 3 pounds extra to sit on the front seats from Istanbul to dalaman, bargain again. One word of warning, if you use them to get into Istanbul for a stop over, it's quite far from the terminal to the main areas of Istanbul, so taxis can be costly.",11,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Warning ⚠️ warning ⚠️ warning ⚠️","If the crew on board will ask you to change bills please R E F U S E !

I felt so embarrassed after I tried to exchanged in five different places and everyone of them thought I try to cheat them.

Shame on you Pegasus !",11,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Decent","When I choose an airline, I require a pilot to point the aircraft to the destination and get me there in a timely manner. Pegasus did this absolutely fine. There was no online check in from Manchester, which was good because we didn’t do our E visas. Check in staff were good about it though. The plane felt a bit cramped for me (I am 6 foot) but I wasn’t ridiculously tight. We arrive on time and in good order......which is all I want.",10,"2019",4

"Pegasus-Airlines","Turkish Easy jet","Booked on Pegasus for price reasons only,much cheaper than Turkish Airlines in summer,They are a typical no frills everything is extra budget airline but as long as you go in with your eyes open and stick to their rules you should not have any problems.I found check in and boarding O.K. the cabin crew were quite friendly and I was impressed by the trouble they took over safety matters especially making sure people seated in emergency exit seats were aware and capable of their duties in case of an emergency even saw them move two aged Turkish ladies from these seats as they clearly did not understand what was required of them.As with all budget air lines all food and drink is to be paid for but there is nothing to stop you taking your own.In flight entertainment is also chargeable but you can listen to your own music.I have read complaints about ground staff charging people for hand luggage ,but I did see the ground staff in Istanbul doing this but the bags the people were trying to get on were massively over the size allowed so can""t see how they can complain.I have also read complaints of people transiting at Istanbul having trouble with the lack of signs but I found the signs adequate and transited with no problems. The main thing is to read all the terms and conditions,stick to their rules,turn up on time and remember how much you have paid and you should not have any problems.",10,"2019",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","uncomfortable","only if you have to because of the price. and if you British citizen you need a visa, that you can do in the airport, but don't go to boarding control without it. you will feel midnight express experience which is not that much fun.
also try not to get to saw which is far fro, the European part of Istanbul and if there is no other choice, just take in consideration
a 50 dollar taxi to the European part of Istanbul",10,"2019",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Family holiday flight","We’ve just returned from a family holiday to Turkey and flew with Pegasus for the first time.
The service was fantastic, seamless check in on way out and home with no problems at all.
The flight itself was comfortable and a little more leg room than previous flights with alternative airlines.
We didn’t have any food on the flight so can’t comment but the drinks were fine.
We would definitely travel with Pegasus again.",10,"2019",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Awful","Flight was unbearably hot; poor air circulation; food was not brilliant; no water (unless one was prepared to pay an extortionate price for a small amount in a plastic bottle) even though passengers are not allowed to carry water onboard in a recyclable bottle and no water was obviously available in the airport, even after security checks. The flight was delayed for an hour, but it took ages for food/drink to be ordered, paid for and then to arrive, as priority was given to those ordering hot food. It was irritating that food was advertised in Euros but charged for in Turkish Lira. Worst thing of all was that there was a large number of babies on board whose parents were unable to control their tantrums. It is by no means a foregone conclusion that babies will scream incessantly on flights (NB screaming in temper should be distinguished from normal CRYING) . I have flown on numerous occasions where babies/children have been perfectly well behaved.These children were uncontrollable, so it was either lack of parenting skills, or child cruelty, forcing children onto flights which distressed them so much it caused them to scream. It was extremely stressful for me as a a passenger, but the staff were nowhere to be seen. If I were to scream like that, I have no doubt that the police would be waiting to arrest me on landing even though the stress was enough to make me scream. I had no objection to the fact that there was no inflight entertainment as the flight was cheap, but I would have paid extra for increased air circulation. I understand it is kept to a minimum to economise on fuel usage ?",10,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","DISGUSTING!!","Absolutely disgusted at this airline, and I will never use it again and will make sure to let people know how much of a rip off it is. My daughter was travelling with this airline to Qatar, with a stop off in Istanbul. She checked 2 bags one was 19kg and the other was 20kg. We asked the woman if we could pay for the 2nd bag and she said yes. But before she told us the price she processed the bag and gave us a print out to go pay at the desk across the terminal. On arrival at the pay desk the lady told us the back would cost £380 FOR ONE BAG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My daughter didnt have the money but the bag had already been processed and gone through so she had to pay! I think this is absolutely disgusting and this airline should be allowed to charge so much for one bag! I will NEVER use this airline AGAIN! SHAME ON YOU PEGASUS AIRLINES!! 🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬",10,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Dirty Grubby Unhealthy Plane","It’s unfortunate that this airline doesn’t prioritize aircraft cleanliness.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Decent Budget Airline","Had a decent experience with the airline considering the price. The thing I liked was the smooth experience from booking to checkin which was easy and hassle free. Every other thing in the airline is paid ie meal, baggage, leg room , flight entertainment. Flight was on time.",10,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","No frills","As a user of budget airways I found Pegasus better than some. Extra legroom well worth extra £14 each way. Just be aware that there is very little at Izmir airport.",10,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst experience ever","They cancelled the flight before 3 hours of departure which leave us with no solutions which is not acceptable at all.

In addition no body was in check in station from Pegasus airlines.

No After sales service.

Not recommend for an enemy.",10,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Economic flight s","The airline is ok .The price was cheap but it us not comfortable and the seats are fixed cannot be moved.we travelled in low season other wise could be disaster if the plane is full.the food in board is so bad no body can eat it .coffee and soft drinks are ok",10,"2019",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","When according to them the supervisor is always right and not the customer","Istanbul to Athens. We had 2 different PNRS and they took all of the luggages under 1 PNR (which obviously means the 2nd one didnt have any registered luggage) and charged us 105€ extra without explaining the situation. They never fixed their mistake but just threatened to cancel the flight unless we paid. The funny thing is how it was shown in the system what happened and Pegasus Athens was supposedly taking care of it while their call center - to which we were emailing in Turkish - literally mailed that we exceeded the luggage allowance and that they never give wrong information. And that their supervisor said there were no extra people there that is why they added all the luggage under 1 PNR. Which was a lie because the people from the 2nd PNR were called to give their luggage and my mother was asking for their own group's luggage stickers which they never got- because they had to wait for them to make the mistake of adding all of them in one PNR . So my mom received 8 stickers for luggage and paid 105€. Their way of handling these situations by literally calling you crazy and saying how the supervisors report matters more - and that you should use your legal rights- it's just frustrating.
Photos of how all the luggages added under 1 single name of 1 PNR. Well according to them they were right because.....well that s what the supervisor told them. We will sue them and make more money than what paid",10,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Did not care for Americans!","The staff on the flight didn't care if they waited on us or not. I bought the premium economy plus a sandwich for my wife and I. The turk next to us received a napkin and water with out asking but basically they threw our sandwiches at us and turned around and left. We travel with instant coffee in our luggage and found that a baggage handle took the lid off and dumped it all over my wifes clothes. FLY TURKISH AIRLINE!",10,"2019",1

"Pegasus-Airlines","Top Notch for a Budget Airline","I had a lovely flight with this company. I had just experienced a terrible flight the day prior which actually gave me a panic attack which I never had and made almos all the passengers ill due to poor flying skills. there was no turbulence but the pilot was incompetent. ON this airline the crew was so helpful to me I did not have any fear whatsoever. I must say ot is thanks to the Turkish flight crew. I love Turkey and they do everything with class even budget airlines. It is a budget airline and therefore does not have the elegance of Turkish air but it has the class. It was comfortable and impeccably clean but best of all was the flight crew. Thanks.",10,"2019",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Lies and more lies","I was very disappointed with the flight and staff who over charged me for luggage. I paid for extra luggage through the app but I was told the 40 kg that I paid extra for was free and included within my ticket price and my son had no allowance dispite paying full adult rates.

In had the police called on me at the airport when I tried to stand my ground but fortunately the policeman was very good and took my side. The staff wasted over 2 and a half hour of our time and the only way we could get on the plane was to pay extra.

After writing to pegasus they now say they have investigated but have all the facts wrong and have refused to refund the extra charges.

They have unfortunately ruined our holiday at the last and left us so disheartened that we will definitely not be travelling with them again.

I hope Trump sanctions the airline and puts them out of business.

That's a photo of the staff that overcharged us and called the police on me.",10,"2019",1

"Pegasus-Airlines","Pegasus Airlines is fraudulent company - don't fly with them","In October 6 my family and myself were flying from London to Tel Aviv. We had a connection in Istanbul (SAW). We did check-in in Stansted airport in London. During check-in our luggage and all of our belonging were weighted. We checked in one bag, they put a cabin sticker on our hand bags and we proceed on. When we arrived in Istanbul we went to the gate.
After our boarding tickets were scanned, we were stopped by a team of 3 ladies on the way to the airplane. They told us we seem to have too many items (3 kids family). One of the ladies took out 5$ scale and started to measure our bags. at the end we were told to pay extra $160 for over weight. We insisted we are not paying and that all of our bags where weighted by Pegasus in London and that it's our 4th flight with Pegasus with the same bags. The 3 ladies were very rood. They grabbed our bags by force and start to label them with some green stickers without asking, they wanted our passport and boarding tickets and that they are going to call the police (2 parents with 3 kids aged 11, 9 and 5). In that point our kids started to cry. We insisted not to pay. When we asked why $160 we were told we have 16Kg over weight and we need to pay $10 for each. After we refused they told us we can't get o the airplane since we are dangerous for the flight since we attacked them (that was a lie) we were told that our check-in bag will be removed from the airplane and we will be able to collect it in lost and found. The 3 ladies team left to the other gate to do the same thing. We went to pick up our check-in bag. Obviously it was not there since they will not delay the flight to take it off. We went on to the tickets office and we spoke with the check-in area supervisor. Each place we arrived, a minute after one of the 3 ladies team arrived, speaking with the attendant in the office or with the supervisor and then we were told sorry I can't help you. She's Pegasus most superior manager currently in the airport and I can do nothing. End of story, we spend extra $960 on new tickets to fly to Tel Aviv. the only tickets we could get were with Pegasus and online using edreams, we could not get flights in the airport but only extremely more expensive. Also we spent the night with our kids in the airport and arrived home 14 hours later. Bottom line, Pegasus is a fraudulent company they have ad-hoc teams to squeeze money from passengers in a fraud way.
During the night I called Pegasus airlines customer relations. A guy answered and after 2 minutes I tell the story he disconnected the line. I dialed again and was answered and disconnected. Eventually, another guy answered listened and told me to get a new flight tickets. He also told me to file a complaint in the write to us section.
When you go to Pegasus Airlines web site to write to us section or contact us there's no place you can file a complaint. So if you decide to travel with Pegasus Airlines, specifically if you travel with family, take into account sometimes you need to pay ""Bakshish"" - bribery to really get on the airplane. I don't pay ""Bakshish"" so this is my last flight with Pegasus airlines.",10,"2019",1

"Pegasus-Airlines","BUDGET ON PAR WITH RYANAIR EASYJET etc","Reasonably swift boarding pleasant crew unlike some Ryanair staff on previous flights. Although the air crew tried to control the passengers a lot of them simply ignored the fasten seat belt signs and were always being asked to switch off phones etc. A fellow traveller said this was typical of the clientele for this airline, he was Turkish and said as its cheaper than Turkish Airlines the inconsiderate side of the passengers comes out.",10,"2019",3

"Pegasus-Airlines","Waste of paper and Useless processes to keep people busy","I am flying to prague from bishkek Airport with connection in Istanbul. I checked in online as always TO SAVE MY TIME and avoid all the queue hussle at the airport but apparently you MUST have a printed boarding pass on all pegasus flights departing from bishkek which I discovered only after having passed passport control and security check. There was a guy stamping all the boarding passes right after security check and he didn't let me in the gates area. He couldn't explain why the e-boarding pass is not sufficient and sent me all the way back to the registration desk. At the registration I was explained that they print all the boarding passes in order to know who showed up for the flight and if someone running late they will know that at the gate and will wait for the late ones. What the hell? Pegasus and Manas, listen, if someone is late they simply don't fly and those who checked in online don't have to pay for it with their time.
I had to spend 20+ minutes to go through the whole process and I am not happy about it.
Know that you are wasting paper and excusing unpunctual people, while punishing those who try to save your time and their time by checking in in advance.",10,"2019",2

Also be sure to stick exactly to the weight limit as we had to pay for being 2kg over the allowed limit.",10,"2019",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Terrible Customer Service","This was my first and last time using Pegasus Airlines.

I first flew with them from Lviv to Istanbul. This flight wasn't as bad and was fairly quick. The negative thing is that they were delayed and taking off and about 30-45 minutes delayed after landing. I thankfully (after running through the entire airport) made my connecting flight.

By biggest issue however, was my flight back to Ukraine!! I arrived about 4 hours early to the Antalya airport. 3 hours before my flight from Antalya to Ankara, I received a notification stating that my flight was an hour delayed. This was a problem being that my connecting flight to Kyiv, which was all done through Pegasus Airlines, left at the time of our new arrival. While I was in the airport, I went to the Pegasus head office and inquired about this dilemma. The woman at the window assured me that I would be fine, even after I walked her through how it didn't make sense for me to make the flight on time since we land while the other one would be taking off. I then asked if they provided some type of reimbursement for the flight that I knew I would miss. She assured me that that was unnecessary.

I boarded my delayed flight to Ankara and as expected, I missed my connecting flight. In Ankara, there was a man who greeted the people who had missed their connecting flight to Kyiv. My biggest issue was that Pegasus Airlines only reimburses you if you use their airlines. They were not accommodating for those who had chosen to arrive on the next plane and had to use another airline, use our own money, plus had to spend the night in the airport, and eat in the airport. NONE of the Pegasus Airlines representatives cared to help. I was disappointed with the customer service the most, as well as their stinginess to not want to reimburse people who had to pay for an extra flight because of their lousy mistake!!

I then tried to file a complaint (which, can not be done officially through their site). From July to September was a long ride between searching (literally searching) for a way to contact them, yet alone find a number or email that worked; finding the rights of the customers; emailing them reminding them continuously; having different non-native speakers tell me that this is nothing to worry about; and so on.

In short, pay a few extra bucks and choose a better budget airline. I will never fly Pegasus Airlines again, and I feel that no one should.",10,"2019",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Most uncomfortable plane","First and last flight with Pegasus

"Pegasus-Airlines","Pay extra for a better Airline","What can I say that the title already didn’t. This Airline by far is the worst I’ve ever used and I travel internationally a lot. For starters their booking process rearranged my name and I had to get that fixed with them( no big deal). Then when we lined up for what was supposed to be our boarding time they took over an hour to get the plane ready so no we are behind schedule. Once we finally got on the place and I found my seat it was very cramped. I am tall with long legs and I didn’t really fit good in their seat. It’s too close to the one in front of it. Also the plane was filthy, dirty tissues crumbs and who knows what else. There’s no inflight entertainment for my 4 hour flight I had a very extra plus sized individual spilling over onto my side and I couldn’t lay my seat back because then the guy behind me will suffer. This is a good airline if you have a short distance and wanna save some money.",10,"2019",2

"Pegasus-Airlines","Won't fly with them again","What an experience - best not repeated. Cabin crew had no control over passengers, most of whom acted like 5 year olds. No sooner had plane touched down than passengers were pulling their luggage from overhead lockers, totally ignoring announcements to stay in seats. Food look very unappetising and very expensive. At gangway, crew stood bad and let passengers push and shove to get off. Was prepared for return journey which was just as bad.",9,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Great flight","As I have a disabled husband the care and assistance that he had was beyond our expectations. Nothing was too much trouble and everything was done with a smile.

"Pegasus-Airlines","The world’s rudest staff","If you have never booked a flight with this company then definitely you didn’t experience the world’s worst airline (lucky you).
I never ever came across such rude staff. After having the baggage checked in, we had the handbags tagged, which means they are ok to go. Just before boarding some very impolite staff weighed the handbags with a small stuff, I don’t know if it is calibrated or even gives correct value. We were asked to pay exorbitant for each kilo. The staff wouldn’t want to listen to anything and keep repeating pay or throw the bags. Just few minutes before departure, they accepted to be paid in foreign currency. She took all the banknotes that I had in my wallet without even count them. When I asked for a receipt, they said there is no time now and I can ask for one at destination. However, on arrival no one was there. I had the impression that I was dealing with a band of amateur thieves not an airline company.
To be avoided absolutely",9,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Great Flights!","Was a bit nervous using pegasus airlines as I hadnt heard of this airline prior to looking on momondo. Booked it as it was the cheapest option with good baggage included (20kg per person). It said clearly on the website that meals/in-flight entertainment weren't included but tbh the price difference between this flight and a flight with those amenities was about £200 more expensive per person! So we decided to book with pegasus because we figured we can take our own entertainment/food for a lot less.

Leg room was actually the best I've ever experienced in a flight. Might have been bc we werent expecting much but seemed quite good for the price we paid! Also there was 2 of us travelling and in 3 out of 4 flights we had 3 seats to ourselves so could spread out. Even in the flight where we had one seat each there was ample space.

Would recommend if you're looking for a cheaper option that is still comfortable and you can make your own food/provide your own entertainment. Tbh there was food and in-flight entertainment for sale on the flight but bc we brought our own we didnt need it. But its reasonable to say that even if you purchased food/entertainment on flight it wouldnt be £200 lol.",9,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Better than expected.. pay for extra legroom.","We read truly horrific reviews of Pegasus, but we’re pleasantly surprised.
Extra legroom is only an extra £ 10 each way and for this you get better legroom than any airline.. including Singapore airlines.
I must mention that without the extra legroom, it did look very cramped .
8kg hand luggage is generous and they give a 20kg hold luggage as standard!!!
You have to buy food and drinks on board , but they are very very reasonably priced and it’s actually good food !!!
4 out of 5 for me for an airline if this standard , it knocks spots off Ryan Air !!!
Just don’t go in expecting anything more than a budget airline and you’ll be pleasantly surprised.",9,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Not as expected","The airline is pretty cheap but I honestly expected to be better than this, the chairs are way way too tight, no legroom whatsoever and the landing was absolutely horrible, the cabin crew were very unfriendly as well. However the flights were on time and there was no loss in luggage which I usually expect in cheap airlines.",9,"2019",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Not a bad experience","I was booked on a Pegasus flight to Istanbul as part of a surprise birthday treat . When I read the on line reviews of the airline I thought it could be a disaster . In reality it wasn't that bad . Yes it was an hour late departing and we were sat on the plane for most of that time and it was about 20 minutes late getting away on the return flight , but I have had similar issues with other budget airlines . Overall I would say it was on par with Easy jet for the total experience and better than Ryanair ( but walking on broken glass is better than going anywhere with Ryanair )",9,"2019",4

"Pegasus-Airlines","Still fighting about a canceled reservation!","I booked through Expedia Austria an all inclusive flight transfer and hotel to Antalya/Lara. I booked on Friday Aug 30th.

The flight was Pegasus leaving September 2nd 11:20 AM from Vienna.
I arrived to the airport and my and my companions name was canceled. Who canceled it ?? No idea, either Pegasus or Expedia..why? No reason.
While authorized by Expedia to buy another ticket at the airport (after spending 3.5 hours on the phone standing at the airport) now neither companies want to refund my authorized expense.
Now fighting for a refund from Expedia who claims it was Pegasus who canceled.
The passenger/carrier contract was NOT honored by either Expedia or Pegasus.
I lost a day of vacation from the overcharged package I lost the $50 transfer I lost an additional €638 for the flight I am trying to claim and not being honored.
Final conclusion Pegasus and Expedia Austria unfair business practice from both DON’T TOUCH EITHER !!",9,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","an average cheap charter airlines","This is a cheap charter airline that can get you from the middle east and Europe to Turkey and back, plus for travailing inside Turkey with relatively cheap cost but with limited accommodations and services.",9,"2019",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","wrong pricing advertised","I have paid to secure a price of 350 euros from Sharjah to Lyon return ticket.

Once I want to pay my ticket with the price secured then the pricing is jumping from 350 euros to 394 euros. Come on 12.5% jump!

I ask the customer service why did I pay to secure for nothing? there answer is laughable they said it was because of the exchange rate ... in less than 2 days jump of 12% ?

They are liar and advertise the wrong pricing. I even have screenshots of the 350 euros price but they after contacting their customer service they just don't care.",9,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Just horrible! Dirty, no space, disgusting!!!! Worst flight I ever had in my life.","I hope to never have to fly this company again. The plane was really dirty. I think I have never seen this: the magazines through which they were selling food & beverages were so destroyed, you felt disgusted to just touch it for ordering something. I bought a seat in the front row hoping to have more leg space but no chance! The space is like 15 cm, the seats are small and fixed and the plane was stuffed with people.

Hey hope to never have to fly this unprofessional company ever again.",9,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Totally disappointed - we were standed","we were delayed checking in Beruit airport due to coas at the airport in and missed our flight for a short break to Istanbul - Pegasus Airlines refused to assist us and we were stranded at the airport and had to make our own alternative plans with no communication nor empathy at all it was roughly 29 travellers who missed there flight with us",9,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","My suitcase was damaged","We chose this airline because of the lower fare, but our suitcase came with a broken handle and without a tag. When we complained we were told same incident had frequently happened to a few more customers. I wish they would train their ground personnel for better baggage handling.",9,"2019",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Comfortable seats.","Just flown for the first time with Pegasus from Manchester to Dalaman. Easy check in at both Airports comfortable seats plenty of leg room staff were pleasant i would recommend flying with this Airline.",9,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Overall good","The airplane itself was good and clean, the staff were friendly. But the time of the flight was horrible",9,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Baggage allowance","Overall the flight was good. Restrictions on baggage allowance on internal flights resulted in us paying for extra baggage. When checking online it said 20kg per bag. But when we got to the counter we had to pay for the additional 5kg each.
When traveling internationally one does spend on goods bought in the country. This restricted us from buying.",9,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","good planes for cost conscious clients","Newer clean flight, good legroom. Prices are excellent in particular the tickets that I bought close to travel date, They offfer snack and tea, shich is nice for these tipes of companies",9,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst airline ever","It was the first time and the last time that I travel with this airline....
1. All of my souvenir from dubai was broken.
2. You could ask for a blanket...never the worst service in the plain...
3. Everything chragable with ridiculous pirces.
4. My luggage got broken during the traveling3...
5. The plain smells horrible.... and the toilets in the plain very dirty...",9,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Connecting Europe to the Middle East","After reading so many negative reviews, I must admit, I was nervous prior to my flights. Check in and BCN was hassle free, friendly ground staff, crew and pilots made plenty of up to date announcements whilst en route. Clean, great legroom using the new A320Neo. It's a no frills airline, so you do have to pay for your hold baggage if you have more than your complimentary 8kg cabin allowance. Not a great choice of food and beverages, especially the alcohol selection, the menu could be improved if I was to have any complaint so far using Pegasus. Transit through SAW is fine, plenty of food and drink options available. Transit security a bit hectic. Thanks to Pegasus Airlines.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Not bad not perfect, but I can recommend Pegasus","So that was 2nd time for me when I flew with Pegasus.My first time was from Vienna to SHARM el sheikh and now from Sharm to Zurich.
All was ok, I havent had any problem both times, all was ok organized, no delayed flight, customer service ok- but when you call them they will never answer to you
Good budged airline, I can recommend.
My luggage has been never delayed too.",9,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Nice and very cheap","The best thing to describe Pegasus airlines is to say pay up to the service you want to have, my flight was from Istanbul to Adana, it was the cheapest flight overall and you can choose your seat for 1,20 USD only",9,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Not great","No friendly welcome on board, nobody helped to find the seat. And I actually found gum on my seat!! Ridiculous.",9,"2019",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Average , Cheap","I have fight in August with my family the airplane was small and narrow and unpleasant smell especially some passengers brought food on board before flying they switched off the AC was sooo hot , if the flight is 3 or 4 hours it's ok not bad.",9,"2019",2

"Pegasus-Airlines","Cheap, quality and timely","Pegasus ticket prices are less than half that of other airlines, have good quality and have a safe flight.",9,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Cheapest and convenient way","It was convenient and cheap as compared to Turkish airlines but definitely cannot expect a very comfortable seat and service. the travel from Sabiha to Istanbul was long with a lot of traffic when we landed in the morning but returning back was easier. i would definitely say it's worth the pay, nothing more nothing less.",9,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Hobson's choice","Getting to Sharm in Egypt is not easy and on this occasion we used pegasus.
From the start I was uneasy and felt they were the equivalent of ryanair charging for everything possible. I prepaid for an extra 5kg on one of our cases and glad we did as total weight for our 3 cases got questioned on way out and back. my scales were exact..airport ones read 1-2 kilos more.???
Flights were good and on time both ways. return flight was changed and meant longer wait in istanbul in early hours which was not pleasant.
Would I use again..probably as much cheaper than egyptair but times very unpleasant.
Not sure why but all messages cme through in turkish despite making booking in english and not possible to get translation while on holiday..just glad nothing major changed",9,"2019",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Stop over in Istanbul","Clean plane, lovely seats , on time . Stop over no problem as turkey airport was amazing , plenty of places to eat at !",9,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","The worst and greediest Airline","The flight was dirty and the staff unfriendly. I paid for extra for entertainment and there was no entertainment. I asked the air hostess ( guy) he replied me rudely to mail Pegasus and that they will refund me the money which I paid for entertainment.

Don’t pay for entertainment it’s a trap.",9,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","On time, basic service, value for money","Very new aircraft (Airbus A320-200). On time departure and landing. Kind staff. As this airline is a low-cost one, the price is really low (1500 Turkish Lira = 235 Euro with 8 kg cabin baggage for return journey). However, if you would like to eat, drink, and to be entertained, they are also possible at an extra cost. The only disadvantage is the arrival time in Muscat which is 03:20 in the morning.

I recommend this airline and flight to those who seek basic, on time, and safe air transportation.",9,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Not impressed","I was cabin crew for years and therefore disappointed with this service. Firstly the cabin crew both journeys did not check boarding cards which is a security check. They also did not secure the cabin sufficiently on take off and landing, plus allowed passengers to get out of their seats and collect baggage from overheard compartments when the aircraft was taxiing. They were unfriendly on both journeys. When I went to use the toilet, toilet rolls and hand towels were all out of stock. I asked the cabin crew for toilet roll and was given napkins. Thankfully for me I knew how to open the stock cupboard inside the toilet and restocked it myself. Seats were pretty standard for economy and the same for comfort levels. Would only use this airline again if I was desperate.",9,"2019",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","🇹🇷✈🇦🇪✈","I use Pegasus for my most flights to Turkey. Very cheap compared to other companies (by 200%). Good service. Good food. Average Airplane (Airbus A320). Average seats. Compared to its price its amazingly great.",9,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Planes condition","Fair prices. But planes cleanliness should be better, some seats are very old with broken arms and scratched leather, and uncomfortable legroom.",9,"2019",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Badly mannered Customs official","I found the one customs official to be very rude in her handling of customers and their luggage. Instead of kindly informing people when they have items in their handbags deemed not fit to be taken on board the flight, she tended to be rude, abrupt and quite disrespectful about it. Other than her, the rest of the flight and its employees were quite a pleasure to fly with.",9,"2019",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Disgusting staff","I was booked for 2 flights with a 2 year old baby and my husband was already waiting in Saudi for me. I was a nervous wreck as I had never flown on my own with a baby before. From the moment i went into the airport It was an experience from hell and i felt so awkward and uncomfortable. I made for departures but didn't realise i had to check in, then when I checked in i was confused as my flight was showing on the board but they were checking in the flight before. The staff were extremely abrupt and unhelpful. Then when i finally got to departures i had a thorough investigation and after i got to my gate i noticed we had stairs to climb down but this was impossible with a baby, Pushchair and 2 hand luggage. So i asked the asian lady in the photo below and she was so awful and rude to me, she shouted at me infront of the passengers, i could not help but cry my eyes out from the nasty response she gave me. She said noone will help me downstairs, i should of booked extra assistance when i booked my flight and its my own fault. Not to mention she is supposed to be a Muslim like myself and this is not how Muslims act towards each other. So much more happened but I leave it in Allahs hands. But she should not work with people, but this airline is disgusting and I will learn my lesson. The plane was filthy, they didnt even give me my hot food until i asked for it, the flight was good and the pilot did a good job with take off and landing. I will never forget the disgusting treatment i had at Stansted from both the ladies pictured. The blonde woman helped me down the stairs and when i got to the bottom she said to me that next time dont bring so much stuff, i said im moving abroad you horrible person. Some people dont deserve to work with public, they think they get away with anything.",9,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Flight to izmir","E again for sureGreat flight , service on board very good would use again , crew helpful choice of menu for all",9,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Good Services with Affordable Prices","The flights in general are good, I travelled with Pegasus airlines 4 times since Dec 2018, and my family is using it since that time. Trips accuracy is almost 100% with no delays, staff are really perfect and helpful, menu variety is good as well, and takeoff is almost good.

Now, two point I would like to see better: 1) landing experience is not as smooth and other airlines like Emirates, Turkish airlines, Qatar airways, or Royal Jordanian. The flight keep shaking till touching the ground, and this note is on all flights and in both airports, Amman & Ankara.
2) I took two trips on old ago flights, so the chairs are exhausted, windows are filled with scratches... So you don't feel relaxed during the trip.

In general, timing is good, prices are good, staff is perfect.",9,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Overall a good experience","I flew with this airline for the first time back in July and overall it was a pleasant experience. Some of my family members were elderly and therefore needed assistance which we got with zero complaints. Furthermore, the customer service in the airport and online were great and very helpful. They made our journey really smooth.

The airplane itself was okay for a low cost airline. The leg room wasn't great but it wasn't cramped either. Was just okay. Flight left on time from both UK and Turkey so overall I would say it was a good experience.",9,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Good","kindly staff, the duration ef our flight is 3 hours, not too long so it's comfortable for a small nap, the delay is acceptable (15 20 minutes)",9,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","very good","The flight was pretty good. It was a connection flight with Alitalia and Azerbaycan Airlines so we had 20 minutes delay but the rest was good. People are friendly and helpful. Pegasus Cafe prices are moderately reasonable. I suggest you to use Pegasus.",9,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","PEGASUS - another Turkish company of note 10 + ...","We have booked 3 round trips tickets on flypgs.tr since January 2019 for August 16, 2019 with return on August 24, 2019.
The 3 tickets were very cheap and, due to the fact that in Istanbul the new airport was used in 2019, we had to change the flight time, which became very fast and very cheap.
For modest amounts, we reserved places with extra space at the feet and included menus, which were served to us on the plane with personalized labels, for each dish and were also heated.
The PEGASUS staff was extremely friendly, both in airports and in airplanes.
We could buy personalized gifts with PEGASUS for 1TL each, so 1/6 eur !!!
The flight conditions were very good and the flights operated without major delays.
In addition, I also accumulated BOL-BOL points !!!
Congratulations PEGASUS !!!
WE'RE BACK!

P.S. The check-in operations were announced to us by email and proved very simple, directly on the site",9,"2019",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Hard","The flight duration was ok but the seats were very hard and uncomfortable. I would have enjoyed the flight if I was standing. The staff were very polite but some passengers were unruly as they change their seats without the consent of the staff. It was not cheap in the price sense but it's just another service-less airliner pretending to provide cheap tickets. I thoroughly enjoyed istanbul and will visit again but not this airliner",9,"2019",2

"Pegasus-Airlines","Affordable flight","It was a bit hot on the airplane, but the staff is so nice. Good service. Good food as well. That's all",9,"2019",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Best price option from Turkey to abroad","In time, cheap so no additional service like even no free water. No mater if you are a faithful customer or not, they admit an arbitrary seat number despite (sometimes) there are empty seats in front.",9,"2019",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","you get what you paid","I did a last-minute purchase and it was the cheapest option that I could go with. There was a 5 hours layover in Turkey and food had to be purchased separately",9,"2019",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Accurate time","Last month my family and I travelled from Tel-Aviv to Istanbul and the return was from Izmir .The time of departures was the exact time given , with easy check in and check out.Great charter flights.",9,"2019",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Manchester to Istanbul - September 2019","We were on time and a no problem flight

"Pegasus-Airlines","good planes","good prices, on time flights with no delays , nice flight attendants good value for the money we paid but the security checks in trabzon airport especially for women were disgusting and exagerated with no sense and respect",9,"2019",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Pegasus with a stop","I would rate Pegasus and recommend flying with them if you are not in a hurry as we had a short stopover to change planes and had assistance from check in until went through passport control, retrieving our luggage and customs.
They gave us quality service and did whatever they could to make our uneventful.
Try them and see for yourself.",9,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","always a good experience with pegasus","I have traveled several times with Pegasus but lately i discovered a new feature the on board entertainment. For almost 2 eur you had great wireless connection to watch movies. They are always on time, the ground staff and on board has been always great with all the persons on board. For a low cost airline and for the price i always bought the tickets i enjoyed the flights with them. For short to medium haul flights it would be great.",9,"2019",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Be very careful flying pegasus","Pegasus airlines is of very poor quality, but more sinister are they are actively ripping people off with excess baggage. The day we left Turkey we arrived at the airport early to weigh our luggage, we were happy as we were well within the weight allotted to us. After we set off to the pegasus baggage check in, there we were told we were in excess by 10 kg. We raised a complaint but the shift manager was rude and useless. After continuing to complain the pegasus agent accompanied us with one of our checked bags and CONFIRMED that the scales were different by about 3kg.

She said we just need to pay the excess but she would raise a complaint with the airline. I emailed them on my return and after 4 weeks they replied with ""Our scales our checked regularly each month so the error is not caused by the scales balance"". A rather pathetic response given the time it took.

Just be very cautious with your checked in bags in the Sabiha Gokcen airport, like many things in Turkey they seem to be pulling a fast one on people.",9,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Good low frills local airline","Pegasus are a local Turkish low cost airline. The service is no frills but the crews were pleasant and really nice.
The flight was on time, the plane modern and we enjoyed the short flight.",9,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Meh","Me and my family were traveling to turkey from Uk. The first lady we met at the airport was slightly ubrupt but other than that she was ok. They seamed quite annoyed and rolled there eyes when you asked something. The flight was good but the Food was very expencive. I had to pay £8.50 for 2 cups of tea and ended up eating a salmon sandwich from pretamanger. My children dowloaded movies on my phone and although there was wifi and i had full bars it did not work at all: youtube, netflix, bbc iplayer and the rest. The rest was ok and we arrived safely.",9,"2019",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Never take this airlines","If you dont want to be treated like a human, never take this airline leaving from beirut lebanon. No respect no values and morals. All employees think they are allah, guy in grey suit and big beard is super visor covers and sides with his workers when there in the wrong. Never take this airline bye",9,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Pegasus: the greed syndrome?","No matter how greedy you are as a person, you can not be that expert in greediness and manipulation as the Pegasus staff is. They will use every (im)possible (il)legal way to make money out of you.",9,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Scavengers money driven and no care for customers.","Reading pages and pages of reviews, I can now officially say this has got to be number one for being rated the worst airlines in history. People be aware if you have transits, make sure to leave at least 6 hours in between transits because they will delay you and you will miss your flight. The worst thing is they will not be held responsible for any loss of money. The staff on the plane are rude and never smile. The air craft is very dirty. The landing is horrible. If you have phobia of flying I think this airline will destroy every last drop of hope. The pilot flying us on the 26th August flight from Istanbul to anatalya @ 3:20pm flight- was probably having a practice day. The plane drops very fast every few minutes during landing. I thought we were descending for emergency but it turns out normal for him. Never again.. if it was the last flight to save my life.",9,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Economical travel from Istanbul to Izmir.","We found the flight online and our travel agent double checked it and gave us ""thumbs up"". The flight was on time and the assistants friendly and helpful.",9,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Pegasus insults its customers","Some tips:
Be aware that Pegasus staff will not talk to you in English or in any other language than Turkish in Istanbul.
Pegasus disrespects their customers. It is quite usual to hear such texts from them in Istanbul: ""who cares about one customer when there are thousands of passengers using Pegasus every day"",and offensive language (F CKetc.",9,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst airline company to have ever used in my entire life time.","I have been in easy jet, rayan air, fly Dubai and many other low cost carriers but nothing was as cheap in quality and service as Pegasus airlines. Rude staff and unfriendly. I have missed my flight from Sabiha Istanbul to DXB due to a delay on this terrible airline company. When I spoke to them they were unfriendly and unsympathetic. Moreover I booked my dad and mum unfortunately on this airlines from Antalya too to Istanbul then to London Gatwick. My bank feud department declined the transaction I failed to receive a confirmation in time so I duplicated the booking yet they refuse to refund me for the twice paid for tickets. I feel this coming is desperate to make money even at the expensive of maintaining potentially loyal customer. The expression of cheap applies to Pegasus. Never again. People please never use this company. They are not worth your money.",9,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst airlines","Never had such experience. They are the worst and they have double charged me for 2 flights on the same time.",9,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","An economy carrier with new planes great for internal flights","I flew from Istanbul to Izmir on this new budget carrier this weekend. The check in process was swift, and the boarding process onto PC3305 though delayed by about 15 minutes was pretty easy too with the three cabin crew very friendly.

The interior of the plane was pretty compact but brand sparkling new. Seat configuration was three seats on either side of a central aisle. Being a budget carrier all meals and drinks were for sale. But only being a 45 minute flight, it felt like we were descending to land soon after we had taken off.

For short flights I would be very happy to fly again with Pegasus and in fact have already booked a return journey with them for the end of the month when I need to fly back to Istanbul.",9,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Be glad you are traveling safely.","I didn't know what to expect and yet here I was on a Boeing, a US made 737-800. It was like going home (to the US). Happy to not be on some rickety prop plane with a questionable safety record, even tho I think some 737's had some recent actual or near crashes. I had not done any research on Pegasus and one begins to imagine the worst with the history of what one has seen and heard about over the years.
The captain making the announcements had a German accent. Either he was German or just had the accent which entails German upbringing. Another good safety point as Germans are usual precise and exacting. Mind you these are just my perceptions which may prove to be false.
The flight was 1:40 hours and decent enough, but these flights are in the middle of the night which disrupts one's biorhythms. I felt like I do after I cross the Atlantic or Pacific. In addition, all drinks, soft drinks, juices, etc. cost an additional amount. Just an FYI.
The departure desk was under duress with computer glitches out of Amman, but was fine out of Antalya. In addition, be careful of weight restrictions. Many people had to step out of line to rearrange or get rid of stuff unless they wanted to pay the overage charges.
I was happy enough with Pegasus and would travel it again.",8,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Coming from A to B in a different way","Using this route was purely based on coming from A to B in a time of the year, when airline prizes seem to go through the roof.
Cheap compared to others - Yes, kind of
Service - As expected. If you ordered food, then service is ok. Anything else, you have to pay for & don't expect water bottles being offered at your seat - You will have to pay as well.
Housekeeping of Cabin - Clean & Tidy
Seats - Terrible, as you have to be less than 180cm in height & don't think about being a bit more ""sized"", you will have difficulties to fit the narrow seats.
Was I ok on arrival - Well, 2 reasonable short flights, but it felt much longer, as you can't expect any good sleeping comfort?
Entertainment like Movies/radio/ music - What do you expect? The answer is no
Conclusion: Food served, because it was ordered was good, Cabin crew effective & almost smiling & I got from A to B.",8,"2019",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Good flight","Flightwas a little late , and not so clean , drinks were ok , never seen any food , flight was expensive because liverpool were in istanbul, why the double the price of a flight its just plain greed, was nt many chelsea fans in istanbul,",8,"2019",4

"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst airline ever","Pegasusairline Airline ... I will remember to never book again with this airline.

Biggest scam of the year. You made the top of my list. Charging me more than my flight costed me for having a small backpack instead of a 20 x 20 cm hand bag.

First time in over 100 flights an airline stop me for exceeding by 2 cm this rule.

"Pegasus-Airlines","No problems here","Having read some terrible reviews of this airline I almost decided to cancel our booking but I have to say we had no problems at all. We flew from London to Ercan (North Cyprus) and back via Istanbul. All the staff we encountered in London, on the 4 flights, in Istanbul and in Ercan were friendly and helpful. All 4 flights left on time and staff spoke OK, if not exceptional, English. We didn't purchase any meals on the flights but if you want to do this you need to book them in advance on their website or mobile app. On the flights we were offered a good selection of snacks and drinks though. The stewards came round several times to collect rubbish and responded well to anyone who needed them. You can connect to WiFi on the aircraft and track your flight in real time which is quite cool if you're a bit of a nerd like me, it shows you the flying speed, arrival time and exactly where you are on the route etc. All in all it was a positive experience and for what we paid I was happy. You can't expect to pay 'no frills' fares and get a first class luxury service. Just set your expectations aright and you shouldn't be disappointed.",8,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","The worst airline ever","I had a flight today and I had allowance of 8kg cabin bag and hand bag. They checked both of the bags and told me that my hand bag should be 2 kg and they charged me for the extra weight. I had to pay for it. Then I checked their website, actually there is no such thing. It only shows the size of the hand bag, not the weight of it. The staff was so rude, she treated me like if I was enemy of them not like their customer. I am very upset about it.

Besides that the flight isn’t comfortable, the food has no taste and also expensive. I am very disappointed and dissatisfied. I don’t recommend Pegasus Airlines to anyone and will never use it again.",8,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Absolutely horrible service","I had an absolutely terrible experience with Pegasus airline . I was about to fly to my country from vacation and I was on time at the airport , The queue was so long for
checking in , when I arrived at the counter they told me the flight is overbooked and I had a confirmed paid ticket !!!! They just sold my ticket to someone on the waiting list and told me there is no space for me ! I found it to unacceptable !!! Nine hours later I was flying to Istanbul where I had to stay one night more in Hotel and I was in my country the next day !!! There was another flight with Turkish airways but they didn’t want to pay for it !!! I missed a very important meeting at work and lost lots of money and time !!! I heard from other people that this is quite common for this airline!!!! Don’t book with them if you have any other choice !!!

"Pegasus-Airlines","In general good flight","The staff is not friendly at all and not helpful specially we have twins two years old, they were angry because of kids, when we arrived back to Amman, the kids strollers were not at the airplane gate, they were sleeping with our bags it was very hard to handle them, when asked about the strollers no one helped, we got the strollers with baggage half an hour later.",8,"2019",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","KSA","The worst ever, they will nickle & dime for every thing. Although I made a special extra paid Fast check in (40$), the pegasus attandant rarely looked at me with care, she kept talking to other turkish passbyers.. neglecting checking all my luggage weight & situation. I endedup paying at the airplane door more than 100$ for little excess baggage wieght I'd have avoid, if I truly recieved some of the services that I ALREADY PAID FOR EARLIER. When I refused to pay they Humilitated me amongst all paasengers by preventing me from getting on board on flight & kept thretining me untill I paid it to catch up with my flight.. determining to make it the last flight ever on Pegasus.

I've been in contact with Swissport, which deals with all these issues at the Airport, and each staff member when I call each day gave me different answers, some would say they found my suitcase, others would say they havent. An its literally impossible to get hold of someone at PEGASUS airline that deals with baggage delay.",8,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Excellent!","This was my second short duration domestic flight during my visit to Turkey. No complaints, friendly service right from the check in counter. My son got a cake on flight for his birthday today, that was a pleasant surprise for him. Thank you! Pegasus!",8,"2019",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Do not choose Pegasus Airlines!","Pegasus has MANY TECHNICAL PROBLEMS. Last year I bought tickets for the same destination (Bucharest-Istanbul), but because I forgot my passport at home, my boyfriend and I canceled the trip. So this year, we were very careful with everything, and we made a reservation between 22-28.08.2019, and they sent us a confirmation for 22.08 - 25 September 2019! I even have the print screen of the starting point of my reservation, which clearly shows that I selected 22 and 28 august, and now, if we want to change the ticket, we should pay the penalty cost of 63 euro. So my boyfriend and I were both looking at the screen and it was written 28, so I am now waiting to see what they will say. Don't mess with this company - I will never ever buy from them again. They just want to steal your money.",8,"2019",1

"Pegasus-Airlines","PILOT SMOKED DURING THE FLIGHT","I flew a multi-legged flight with Pegasus. On one of the flights the pilot smoked in the cockpit. Several of us smelled it. Cabin chief checked the restroom (so did I) and there was no smoking smell coming from there so it couldn't have been the passenger). The small was only in the front of the airplane. No ovens were in operation. It wasn't food smell. It was clearly and without dispute, cigarette smell. SHAME ON PEGASUS that it tolerates its pilots smoke in the flight.",8,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Air Dolmuş","I've used Pegasus many times, I'd say I was more satisfied, this time it was very chaotic in comparison with my previous experiences. We were early in line and for some reason, they booked us the seats at the very end. all four of us in separate parts of the plane. however the flight itself was smooth and was right on time in landing.",8,"2019",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Stansted to Istanbul","Flew out for the Super Cup Final. Flight was 90% full.
For a low cost airline we got free checked in baggage.
Seats were comfortable with reasonable legroom.
Aircraft was a B737-800 and was well maintained inside the cabin.
No free food or drink.
No inflight entertainment
The airport in Turkey was on the Asian side of the city and about 1hr away. We took a taxi from the airport and was asked wether we wanted to go the cheap way or the expensive way. Which meant going over the old bridge and having to endure many traffic jams or going on the new toll bridge which would cost us more but may be a lot quicker. We said the toll bridge.
Half way into the city he suddenly turned round and said traffic had cleared so we would take the old bridge.",8,"2019",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Better than any budget british airline!","I was so worried about flying with these after all the bad reviews but i was so thankful i still went ahead! The flight was wonderful. Well mannered and cheery staff, nice smooth journey and easy boarding and landing! The food was served quickly and the toilets were in lovely clean condition! I had more than enough leg room and there was even an option for on flight entertainment. As far as im concerned the flight was the best I've been on in a long time.",8,"2019",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Never again","The flight itself was OK. However, the online portal/website was extremely poor. I had paid to change my flight and my credit card was charged. However, I received no notification from the airline that the changes were made to my flight.

The airline has done nothing to rectify this.",8,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Bad trip","I had such a bad experience yesterday when taking my flights from Beirut to Basel Airport ... As a student , I was and for the first time forced to pay an extra fee on my laptop' s bag (19$/Kg × 5) .
And at the SAY Turkey Airport the lady, that was supposed to check our travel documents before letting us join the plane, was acting weird when a passenger asked her to speak in english instead of Turkish and was taking a shoot of all the passports and biometric residency permits
Actually , I am pissed about all what happened during this trip as much as I feel exhausted .
I think , I will never reserve again with this agency as respect is essential for me",8,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Terrible Delay","The airport was chaotic when we arrived and even though i had on-line checked-in it would have been a task to reach the bag drop desk.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Not more or less than OK","I know that some people don't prefer economic airlines, for me I think it is accepted to fly again with pegasus for no more than four hours flights, it will suits you if you are committed passenger to the airline rules. Do not put high expectations but you can have satisfying experience. I guess the worst thing was that the seat were totally uncomfortable and there is no enough space between the front and back seats that why it not suitable for long duration flights. I went twice on this airline mainly because the departure and arrival timing was suitable to enjoy full day in Istanbul. Landing on Sabiha airport which is far may cost you higher taxi payments, but passing through the bosphorus worth it.",8,"2019",3

We replied to her that they allowed us at that Dammam AirPort and that we later buyed some stuff at dammam AirPort and adjusted our handcarry and That is why its now overweight. She said that its now what matters and not before and charged us 352 TL. We said that we can adjust the handcarry but she replied that last call is also ticking and then we got stressed and payed",8,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Very bad experience with this airline","Well I would like to share with you my experience with Pegasus airline so you can decide if you want to go a trip with them one day !!
First I’m a twin mom having 2 kids and they are 3 years old and carrying 2 handbags and no one would ask for help ! Shame on them ! Even when I asked they said we don’t offer !! My trip was from Istanbul to Antalya for transit and then to Amman.. once I stopped in Antalya airport I was wondering where I have to go no one is specking English and the one who’s working in the Pegasus office at the airport was closing his office might be for break but come on it’s the time of the passengers who’s coming for transit who will guide them! I have no clue!
Thanks god I reached the gate after calling me in the Mic to come to gate 13 ?? And guess what the stroller of the kids after I arrived at amman airport I went directly at the gate of the plane to receive the stroller and a surprise is waiting for me one peace was missing !! And they couldn’t find it !! How come !!!!
The entire airplane was unclean with stains, black handprints, crusty tray tables, and hair everywhere.
Of course can’t forget how the air hostesses are super rude !
And can’t tell you about the TOILET omg was horrible!!! What kind of airline is this !!
Even if it’s a low cost airline , it shouldn’t be in that condition
It’s my first and last trip at this airline..
And I don’t recommend it at all to any one

I swear the normAl bus in Istanbul is more tidy and neat and super comfortable.",8,"2019",1

Dirty and stained seats, grime stuck between seats and filthy trays.

Very basic airline which is expected for the price but do yourself a favour and pay extra for a decent airline.

No entertainment or food unless you pay extra. Seat selection is a nightmare and staff don't make an effort to make the flight easier.

The flights did take off on time though.",8,"2019",2

"Pegasus-Airlines","Budget airline but could do little better","Flew Kayseri (ASR) to Sharjah (SHJ) via Istanbul Sabiha Gocken (SAW). I had another flight few days ago between SHJ and SAW on Pegasus too. Of course it is a budget carrier and offers discounted fares compared to Turkish, Emirates and other carriers. They still do good a job at turning around planes and near on-time flight operations. Some (or may be the most) of their aircrafts have seats that do not recline. The familiar push recline button is missing from the seats. While it may not matter on a short flight within Turkey, for longer flights like between UAE and Turkey (4 hours approx.) it is not comfortable. Also, on PC 2739 (ASR-SAW) on 13 August, had a broken piece of frame inside cabin (will upload the picture). Knew it is not serious to be scary but saw it for the first time and Cabin Crew were either oblivious about it or thought they could not do anything about it until they reach next destination and report it for maintenance.",8,"2019",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Cheap Fares","We flew Pegasus from Istanbul - Kayseri (Cappadocia) and from Izmir to Ankara.
Personally I had no complaints, you get what you pay for. At such cheap prices you can't really complaint. Our flight to Kayseri was delayed by an hour (weather related) while our flight to izmir left on time. In flight service is negligible though like any budget airline you can pay for a few snacks or drinks on board. Perhaps good for short flights no longer than 2 hours. Haven't tried their international routes.
FYI: Their Website can be a bit hit-and-miss sometimes but overall nothing dodgy. Just be sure what add ons you need in terms of luggage before calculating you price.",8,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Cattle class","Arrived in Marseille Terminal 2 - what a disaster. It's a glorified hangar, nothing more. No signs for Pegasus anywhere and finally realised they flash up a paper board when it's time to check in. Check in is a free-for-all and then you are directed to a cattle shed where you put your bags onto a conveyor belt; passport control is the same. Duty free consists of about 5 small shops. We were herded towards the lounge well before take-off time whereupon we sat and waited an eternity for the plane. Left late and the plane was packed. I'm a nervous flyer so asked if I could sit in one of the three free seats next to the escape hatch. 'No' was the curt reply - 2 minutes later a bloke from the back of the plane came forward with his wife, and plonked themselves into the very same seats!! Before take-off, the cabin crew passed twice and didn't spot the bloke next to me had the dinner tray down so he could watch his films. Absolute nightmare trip with kids screaming, running down the aisle and climbing over seats- hate landing but couldn't wait for the moment.
Luckily the return trip was with Turkish Airlines.",8,"2019",2

"Pegasus-Airlines","Cheap fares","My first travel aboard Pegasus Airlines recently. As the fare was very competitive I can't complain. But on 2 out of 4 sectors, the aircraft interiors were really dirty. The tray tables were not cleaned from the previous flight(s) and had sticky and crumbly food debris all over. Seats are very compact, if comfortable. Good for sub-four-hour point-to-point flights. Needless to say, food is no worse or better than most LCCs but flight staff are polite and efficient. No backrest TV screens, naturally.",8,"2019",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","A Budget Airline With High Priced Meals For You To Order On Long Flights","A 2 stage flight setup. Bahrain to Istanbul is a ""Red Eye"" starting about 2 AM. Then a change of planes in Istanbul for the Madrid flight. I ordered a meal from the hot meals listed on the Pegasus Website at the same time I went through the ticket purchase process. Since I was flying two long legs, I paid for 1 meal on each leg of the trip. The cost ran about$9 to$12 per meal. Was it worth it? Since the first flight started about 2 AM and the Madrid, Spain ended about 2 PM...Well you most likely feel better with something to eat. The quality of the food very average airline food in a tine aluminum packet but heated up...

The one annoying thing on the Pegasus Website when you are buying your ticket: I knew that the transit passenger route inside the terminal...puts you back through a security check and with a short time to get to your second flight...I decided to pay the fee to get ""VIP Escorted Fast Movement"".

Crazy strange thing! Although I am on an English page it insisted on turning me to a pure Turkish language page to make the purchase of the VIP Escort Service.
- I tried several times and concluded it was a code loop of some kind.
- It was stated somewhere it could be bought at the airport check in counter.
- The Airport check-in counter crew denied that. The airport counter crew said you have to buy it on the aircraft
- The aircraft crew...looked totally unable to even grasp the service I was referring to and said...IF that exists...you need to buy it off the website...
Yes I think that Pegasus has a real problem on that one.",8,"2019",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","I will rather walk than book Pegasus again!!!","Just before boarding the already delayed flight, I get held by a flight attendant asking to weigh my luggage. I have a cabin luggage (around 6kg) and a backpack with a laptop and a few books. She combines the luggage and says that I'm 4kg over the 8kg allowed luggage. I try to talk sense into her, she replies only: You pay or you stay! Of course I pay, and board the plane, hoping that when I arrive I will contact their support center and they will refund me. However, I receive what appears to be an automated mail that the payment is properly received. I was honestly hoping that I will get at least a proper explanation, but the explanation hasn't come yet, because it must be traveling with Pegasus... MY ADVICE: NEVER, NEVER, NEVER travel with Pegasus if you don't want to end up frustrated.",8,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Long Legs, Close Seating","Entering London Stansted Airport, we found our way to the check-in counter, both of us disabled in different ways, my partner and myself walked (her using her crutches and me with a bad back and arthritis in my lower body), pushing a trolley loaded with baggage. At the counter we were treated with kindness and respect by the booking clerk and the process to as long as it takes, including the changing of the book-in clerk. We were then very sweetly directed to the assistance area, Stansted Airport handles their own disability assistance, so with cabin baggage in hand we trundled off to the designated space. The wait wasn't long, and we were soon whisked through Customs to an area close to the departure gate. The area were we were left had no Internet so we had to wait at a table in a bar for almost two hours. Eventually, we were taken to the departure gate and were loaded onto the plane whilst other passengers were boarding, a very inconvenient situation for us as we felt we were obstructing the process of smooth boarding.
Once on board, we were treated with kindness, humour, and some amazement (I stand at around 1.98 metres or 6ft. 7in.). We found the row of seats that were ours and being an avid amateur photographer I slid over to the window seat. I lifted the handrail between the seats as I have to sit at three-quarters facing the front, almost sideways in the seat because the distance between my back and my knees when I sit is about 30% greater than the distance allowed by the plane's designers. My partner had to lift her handrail too as her body width is greater than that of the allowed dimension.
I requested an extension for my seat belt as I too am somewhat more rotund than I probably should be, and sitting at the angle as I was made it impossible to use the regular belt. The extension was provided in a timely fashion and I was properly ready for take-off. Once in the air my attention was taken by the views outside the window, so I did not pay much attention to the interior of the plane, busy as I was with my photography.
I was offered food, which I politely declined as there was a charge associated with each item, as I did with the drinks and snacks, for the same reason. Eventually we capitulated and bought coffees, which came with a short plastic container of water (an occurrence not uncommon in Turkey and North Cyprus). The coffee was as enjoyable as any instant coffee is, and the water enjoyable as a re-hydrator. We were treated, as were all the passengers, quite well and any of our needs were attended to by a calm and pleasant cabin staff.
During the flight the cabin staff were polite, efficient, and attentive to the needs of all of those passengers whom needed their attention. there were crying children, one child was on his first flight, nervous and scared, all were handled adeptly and caringly by the staff.
The rest of the flight was uneventful.
We waited until the passengers disembarked before we were led to an elevator vehicle which took us to the terminal and again we were whisked through the Customs.
I was taken to the baggage carousel quickly and eventually we made it to the pickup point we had designated with our friends.
That was my journey, if you want to know my partner's experiences, well, I just guess you will have to ask her...",8,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Smooth flight, very professional customer care","This was my first time flying Pegasus which cost half of what other major airlines would've cost. Booking my flights online was easy and straightforward. I downloaded their app and it was useful and easy to use.

Couple weeks before my flight, they sent me a text message to my mobile phone, emailed AND called to let me know of the delays! Most other airlines don't bother informing you of delays until you get to the airport or only send an email! I was so impressed. The customer care rep that called me also gave me tips on how I can change my flight for free! I really appreciated all this.

Check in was smooth, staff very friendly on ground and on the flight and the overall experience was great... better than most major airlines I've flown. Will definitely check them out next time I travel. Great prices, great flights!",8,"2019",5

"Pegasus-Airlines","Pegasus airlines experience Flight PC1824","I highly DO NOT recommend anyone to fly with Pegasus airlines.

I landed In Beirut from Antalya after experiencing the most horrible air hostess experience ever.

The flight ran approx an hour late and the airline did not notify us so we were left waiting at the airport.

The air hostess were absolutely rude and not helpful. When we asked them to help us with placing items in the overhead luggage area we were told ‘it’s not there service’. They were rude and not helpful whatsoever.

I have contacted my travel agency back home and notified them about this experience and they no longer will be using this airline",8,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","MickeyMouse Airlines ™","I asked for water, I got the water bottle after 35 minutes, knowing that I kept reminding the hostess about it and she kept saying we will service everyone soon; I said my sister was super thirsty, she said ""you wait"".
The aircraft is dirty (trays are still sticky from previous passengers) which means it wasn't cleaned after the flight. We would hear very loud noises each time the Captain moves, tilts, or raise the wings. (Which made everyone panic by the way). After I received the bottle of water which costed me like 10 Turkish Liras, I found it to be a super tiny bottle comparing to the price. I asked for a bigger bottle (1 Litres), the hostess said they only have one size (knowing that two minutes earlier I saw her holding two 1 Litres bottles.
The Onboard Wifi (the flight info system) doesn't work (your device will keep obtaining IP address and at the end it say Obtaining IP failed).

The audio system which is embedded on the side of the seats was off. It's just there for nothing.

The air conditioning was on but blowing really almost hot air. All passengers were sweating and complaining. The attitude of the employees was just very rude.
On the floor, I could see some broken covers coving from somewhere.... Like come on pegasus, where is the maintenance? Why does your aircraft release cracking sounds ?
You can never hear the Captain's announcements, the volume is super low, and you can't understand what is he saying. .......
Before landing, one host came to hand comment cards to passengers, he won't hand you a card if you don't ask for it, and he doesn't ask you if you needed one, he simply passes by, and it's your job to notice what's in his hand. Oh and yes, they don't have pens for you to write you comments.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Prevented from boarding for interconnecting flight - no refund","I had purchased a flight from Stanstead to Jeddah for the Hajj pilgrimage on 1 Aug 2019 with an interconnecting flight in Instanbul Sabiha Gokcen. I showed my Hajj VISA at Stanstead to Pegasus with no problems. When I arrived at Istanbul Sabiha Gokcen I was told at the international transfers desk that we were not allowed to go to Jeddah with a Hajj VISA (only business and resident VISAs would be allowed on the flight). We were told we could not have a refund and no alternative arrangements were made for us. To add insult to injury they made us purchase a £20 Turkish VISA to go into the main airport and purchase our own flights with an alternative airline to Jeddah. Eventually I had to go to the main Istanbul Airport and purchase my own Saudia Arabian airline flight. Pegasus staff were rude and unhelpful. They initially told us we would get a refund then told us we couldn't as it was our fault They told us to take it up with Pegasus staff in London if we had a problem who sold us the ticket in the first place. I was alone and managed but other passengers with me had family and were left stranded",8,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Great experience with Pegasus","After booking our flights with Pegasus I looked at some of the negative reviews and then became very concerned however our experience could not be faulted, Pegasus were on time, polite and efficient. We travelled from Istanbul to Dalamen on the 22/07/19 and from bodrum to Rome on the 31/07/19 both flights were excellent.
In Bodrum while waiting for our flight some fragile elderly travelers arrived and were immediately approached by Pegasus staff who quickly organised wheel chairs. They were so considerate and kind. I was very impressed.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Pegasus is the worst airlines on earth and its staff are so rude","They cancelled the journey for three families at the same time for no reason but because the check-in official was working so much slowly. It took me 90 minutes to reach the counter and we my turn came, it took him about 25 minutes to read almost every single word in my 6 passports and Qatari IDs. He opened every page in all the passports, I swear. Finally he gave us the boarding passes and we ran to get our passports stamped and rushed to the assigned gate to board the plane. Here the disaster happened. The officials told us RUDELY the the gate was closed despite that the shuttle was 10 meters away waiting for passengers. They had no tiny feelings toward the families or the kids who started screaming. We tried to clarify to them that it was not our fault but no way. They also talked to us so RUDELY. The man said to a woman ""shut up"" three times.
Finally they left the desk leaving us in our terrible worries and sorrow.
When we gave up, we all went up to Pegasus office but unfortunately the officials there were worse. They took our passports and told us to wait. We asked them many times ""What are you going to do with us?"" But they had only one answer ""I don't know.""
We ask them ""Are you going to give us another booking? ""Are you going to give us hotel to sleep in? Also they said ""We don't know"".
After 3 hours of waiting, they only cancelled our booking and gave us the permission to go out of the airport. After that we were forced to go back to pegasus tickets office and booked a new booking. For me I paid 8311 Turkish Lira. My new flight was 20 hours later. Furthermore, it wasn't easy and wasn't cheap to find a hotel till the new flight comes.

Something very important to add is the way that most, if not all, Pegasus officials treat other people, really the were so bad to others they were very rude. They don't respect others, they don't know how to respect others, they don't know how to be polite to others. The only thing they know is to shout at others, abuse them and insult them. Teally the should be trained how to be human beings to others. I am sorry for everything I said but really Pegasus officials at Sabiha airport are impolite.

If your reputation is important to you, can imagine what idea we will give to the world about your airlines? Do you think that we will travel onboard with you? Remember that some big companies collapsed because a small group of people led a campaign against them. And this what we are going to do.
Finally do you think that you will compensate us and give us back what we paid? We need a full refund and a written apology for what happened to us.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Pegasus! Turn your flight experience into a misery... Even weeks later!","I would like inform everyone about my experience with this company.

I had a flight from London to Istanbul last month. Once I collected my luggage (which is an hardened ABS flight case) I noticed a ten inch long crack on the suitcase. Accidents happen and even hardened suitcases can break(!). Things can get damaged on travel and companies pay for them right? Well Pegasus avoiding to do...

I went to the baggage claim desk and they created a report and they told me I should contact them within a week to make sure they process everything. I did. In the middle of my holiday, I received and email which asking for the invoice of the luggage or a similar item link. I stated that I am on my holiday and cant access my invoices which is 2500 miles away from me. Then I received another email, If I don't take action they will close the case. I have find a cheaper but similar item and send the link.

They know that I am on holiday and they are willing to close the case if I don't provide the link for them.

Then they offered me around £45 which is the half price of the cheaper item. They asked me to confirm the amount. I refused. I stated that the actual item is more expensive and I need to find the invoice and I need a recalculation. I also asked them how they calculate it. Since I showed the item condition (bought it two months ago) I wouldn't expect half price of it. So I wondered how they calculating it. The answer, ""you should look at the Montreal Convention Rules"".

Every mail replied in 3-4 days and always half or stupid answers. Simply they are not willing to pay anything.

I look at my files to find the related invoice. I found it, scanned it and sent it. The amount this time is £129.99 and paid less then two months ago. After three days of waiting they sent me a copy of last email. ""If you confirm the amount......."". No I don't!

I simply stated that I have sent the invoice and they must consider the amount again. Well, after another 3 days of wait. I received another mail. This time the money is in another currency but the same amount. So please note that no matter how much you paid for your stuff, they can break it, they don't even say that they are sorry, and keep offering the same amount.

This is not a matter of money. This is about being right or wrong. I have spent one month, trying to get whats mine! They broke my property, didn't even apologize properly. They are sending quite rude emails and when I asked where I can complain about their customer services ( I asked this question three times) they are ignoring it. What kind of company does that?

Its been more than a month and I am here with an unsolved problem. Seems like I must accept the number they are offering as every hour I am spending with these people I am loosing time and money.

The funny fact is, if I paid £30-£40 more to a company like British Airways or Turkish Airlines, I would still be saving like 80 quid on this flight!

Finished? NO!

On the return flight I purchased a vegetarian sandwich for my flight. When they finished serving the food I received nothing! I asked the flight attendant about my food they brought me a two inch size pastry and they said they are sorry. They forgot to load my sandwich to aircraft. How amazing is that. They offered me a chicken sandwich! They got nothing else... I was extremely tired and not able to argue with anyone. I didn't get something I paid for. I didn't mentioned this in my emails as it can take another month to solve I really don't want to see anything from this company anymore.

My personal recommendation, if you are flying to Turkey, use any airline but Pegasus. You are more likely to get what you paid for...

Turn your flight experience into a misery with Pegasus Airlines.",7,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","The worst","They have bad bad behaviour , bad flight , it is cheap but the worst. When they got our luggage they had bad behavior with us. And get 8 euro for 500 extra weigg of mu suitcase.",7,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Check in agent are useless","A girl in counter d10 almost cancel my flith cause of her lack of knowledge.
I was traveling back to Dubai and I am resident I don't need visa I have my ID card.
So that Human being did not understood her mistake. She just simple told me you need a visa. How come I will buy a visa if I am resident?
After that she start arguing, shouting me in truskish I told her to calm down and speak in English she said I don't need to speak in English.
Is the worst staff I ever ve seen in my life. Is incredible the supervisors and managers don't care.
They live in their ignorance and stain the name of Turkey.",7,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Not comfortable seats in airplane","LowCost without additional services with just hand language. Ticket price approximately 71€.
Be ready to UN COMFORTABLE seats. YOU CANT REGULATE (NO POSSIBLE NO BUTTON IN SEAT) IT IN COMFORTABLE POSITION. If you have sick back you will have more pain, because you need to take your body in one position. This company is killing passengers with sick back in the way with not good seats.",7,"2019",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","family holiday gone wrong?","It was a very horrible plane as we were sitting by the wheels it was rocking so much my daughter was sick over 4 times and the people were not friendly. First, the flight was delayed for over an hour and I was fed up I didn't really care about money I was ready to hop off that plane and book another one. There were lots of bad things that happened on this flight but I really can't be bothered to make these poor souls upset who have booked this flight. Overall, this flight was nasty and all the luck to you if you book this I hope this helped you and i hope you have a better journey me and my family did.",7,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst Airline I have ever travelled on.","I flew 3 times with this Airline, From Istanbul SAW to Kayseri and back to Istanbul; and Istanbul SAW to Prague. The experience was crap from the beginning when and elderly lady and her friend sat in our seats that we had booked. My daughter wanted a winodw seat. The air hostess gave us some other seats to sit it and we had to accept it as plane was full. The food is overpriced and awful. There is no entertainment to speak of. Anyways my main complainte comes from the flight frm SAW to Prague. We sat at the boarding gate for 40 minutes with absolutely nothing going on they were asking other passengers from a flight to Eindhoven to board at the gate for Prague, it was unproffesional and chaotic. When I boarded with my 2 children the guy examined my documents over and over looking at us up and down. When I arrived in Prague my luggage was destroyed and my daughter was very sick. We rushed her home to help her, what a nightmare experience. Some other notes, they changed the times of all the flights.",7,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst airline ever","I was at the airport in SAW and I checked the monitor for the gate ,it was 202B so I sat and waited. When the boarding started I waited at the line and when the ground stuff checked the ticket the said the gate for my flight changed and its 202A so i went there which was right next gate and I sow 5 more people waiting. And the supervisor said that the gate closed and we missed the flight!!that simple .the boarding bridge was still there and the door open but she clearly didn't wanted to help and they closed the gate earlier!rudest ground stuff ever !horrible experience",7,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst airline thus far; takes the art of nickling and diming you to new a low","In general, economy airline travel these days is quite a hell in general, but pegasus takes it to a new low. They mercilessly nickle and dime you... one bag of luggage is $150+, they ""randomly"" assign you non-reclining seats next to the toilet unless you cough up extra cash for seat selection, meal service is not included in long international flights, no in-seat in-flight entertainment even on international flights, ... Do yourself a favor and buy a slightly more expensive ticket (which will turn out to be cheaper after you pay all the ""optional"" fees) on a better airline.",7,"2019",1

"Pegasus-Airlines","Resident of Spain","Abominable treatment of customers by the angry staff. After holding up boarding for 30 minutes, they were unprepared, unhelpful and the delay of bus and boarding resulted in missed connecting flights for passengers. I was lucky and arrived with only a 30 minute delay but soon realized that to catch my connecting flight I had to exit the domestic terminal and re enter through passport control which was for all flights (there was no mention of this from Pegasus and no signs in the airport). The line estimated wait was 1 hour and a half, making it obvious that I would miss my flight if I chose to wait. I asked for help and was told I could buy a “fast pass” for 40 lira (6 euro). This pass did nothing to reduce my wait since the fast track line was already full of families with infants. I had to beg the people in the front of the line to let me pass. Luckily I had a Russian passport and only took 2 minutes since I don’t require a visa. I barely make final call and the staff I asked to help in the line was rude, arrogant, obviously overworked and told me to “go to Pegasus” very bluntly making me assume impossible connections are a common thing with Pegasus airlines (since I didn’t even mention I was flying Pegasus, just that I had a delayed flight and shortened connection). Overall the worst part of the experience was the manner of the rude staff and sales of tickets that are obviously impossible to carry out. If they are selling such tickets, I think Pegasus is a big enough airline to figure out a special transit system to reduce missed flights, reimbursements and bad reviews. The flight itself was absolutely fine and clean. Never flying with connecting flights on Pegasus.",7,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Excellent","I was sailing with friends starting in Samos and progressing up the Turkish coast . Not knowing exactly which port I would finish up in and living in Stansted I was delighted to discover pegasus had a flight from Izmir to stansted. I got off the boat in Foca got a local bus to Izmir £2.50 for 75 Km stayed in a hotel and caught their flight back at 10.05 Izmir airport is brand new air conditioned and comfortable and at that time in the morning almost empty. Check in was quick, check in girl lovely. Immigration friendly boarding on time newish 737 800 air stewardess lovely friendly a snack included .
Took off on time landed on time . Loved that part of Turkey people very friendly and helpful",7,"2019",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Terrible","One minor concern was that people were allowed to bring way too much cabin baggage onboard, causing bedlam in the aisles. However, the main issue was that the pilot opted for a rapid hook turn prior to landing followed by a hooning descent. It was as if he thought he was flying an F45 not a bashed up old Pegasus work horse. This resulted in a landing so rough it would've made MH370 seem smooth. Wish I could give these guys 0/5.",7,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Terrible Airline","Pegasus is really a very bad example how miserable could be service!!!

This airline works against all laws in the world.

The biggst Terror operation of pegasus' staff against the passengers was while waiting for the connecting flight in Istanbul.
Three employees of pegasus have made a terror act against the passengers. So they started checking the handbags and asked people to pay $ 100 a piece.
they have also threatened to arrest passengers so they miss their flight.
The women started crying and the children too. It was a pure blackmail act.

It is really a big scandal, that this airline still is allowed to fly to Europe.",7,"2019",1

"Pegasus-Airlines","Pegasus","got an old plane from pegasus. The seat back in front of me was broken so you couldn't sit upright so it became very cramped. behind me I had a family with 2 small children crying for 3 hours without stopping.
that children are crying is ok, but the broken seat in front of me should have been taken out of service. Staff were aware of the problem because they said nothing to the person who was sitting there during take-off and landing",7,"2019",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Predatory check-in policy","You feel really trapped when you have to check in bags with them. We knew we have extra weight per suitcase but total under limit, but the first check in person confirmed that total is important and no problem. Then she refused to give us a paper for our carry on and back packs and refered us to another aisle(x) where a guy with a very nice watch told us don't worry and send us to check in. Now at the gate a extremely rude and aggressive short guy who acted like he cought thieves stoped us and charged us 150$ for about 10kg of overweight which was distributed over 4 pieces (2 carry on, 2 backpacks). His handheld machine did not work obviously and he had to take us to a computer and charge us while sending us back on the plane where we got lucky to find spot for our carry ones.
2-we had to a change a flight and their phone was not responding at all and their website was completely down for period of 4,5 hours in which the cost of penalty for changing the flight kicked in and I sent them and email to no response.
Overall, it's not good for leisure travelers at all.
Overall, pegaus is an airline for regular business or college students and people who are OK with unclear policies, predatory chargers, and super rude behavior of staff.",7,"2019",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Turkey’s Low cost airline","I occasionally fly with them in Turkey and to international destinations. They can be considered as any other low cost airline in Europe. In domestic flights 15 kilograms of luggage allowance comes free of charge and for international flights the minimum allowance of 20 kilograms comes with an additional fee if needed. They have a loyalty program called “Pegasus Bol Bol” and gives some points depending on your purchases made with the airline; ticket fare, meal-luggage-seat selection purchases. And, If you’re flying from Istanbul Sabiha Gokcen Airport (SAW), get ready for your flight to be delayed.

In my latest experience I had to change my ticket twice. I called their call center, which is also due to charge, to be excused from the latest change because I returned to my primary flight. They answered as “no exceptions can be made, what you paid for the changes stays that way”. Yet, while they have calculated this loyalty program points they didn’t include the full money that I paid for my flight.

To sum up, do not prefer flying with them unless you have no other option (Even while you’re traveling as a couple under the same reservation code, their perfect system might put you 16C and 27B).",7,"2019",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Nothing well","Actually, I chose to go with pegasus to land in Sabiha Airport in the Asian side of the city so I can cross and see the bosphorus along the bridge, and than come back to Beirut with turkish airlines. Comparing the company, turkish airlines is by far better. In general, pegasus has nothing comfortable, they even gave us nothing to Eat or drink. The seats in the airplane were closer one to the other than in other planes. There were no screen or any other entertainment...",7,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Very bad company","Very bad service and very rude in communication once I came back from Antalya to Amman the officer said that my reservation has no luggage so I show him the ticket which mention on it that I have a luggage but he did not look at it and he insist that the original one don't has any.. Accordingly I paid extra fees to ship mine.",7,"2019",1

"Pegasus-Airlines","Cheap but Not professional flight attendant","We had a flight about 20 days ago.
When you book a cheap flight ,it is reasonable you had a very usual airplane,without any meal, No special service; But it is not acceptable to face some tired or weary flight attendant.
No smiling face and no affable appearance. They did not behaved as a professional attandant. May be they work more than routine or get less salary in comparison to other companies. I do not know.",7,"2019",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Not good","Took off an hour late to Istanbul, sitting on hard, uncomfortable seats, no TV. The only saving grace is decent legroom. Next flight from Istanbul to Ercan, again an hour late and uncomfortable seats, no tv. Same on return flights 13 days later.",7,"2019",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Not good at all","The seats are smaller than regular airline seats, very congested, very dirty, wornout seats, the Airline sells their beverages and snacks, no water or juice or anything else.

I would not recommend this fligt to any one.
The seats don't recline.",7,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Not very good","The Pegasus Airline is too congested, no leg space, no TV, no music, ofcourse no beverages or no meals, the airline is very low category.
I did not like the airline at all.

The seats are wornout.",7,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","One of the best flights ever","Before the flight with Pegasus airlines I was really afraid because of the reviews. I was worried about my safety and I thought the seats would not be comfortable because of the lack of space. But the opposite was true. Sometimes it is really best to try things yourself and create your own opinion. I just want to say that my 2 flights with Pegasus airlines were one of the best.
Taking off was on time, check-in went without problems, meals and beverages on board were not as expensive as the people mentioned, legs space was big enough also for people with long legs, everything was clean and Turkish stewardesses were very nice and they were always smiling even at strangers. They themselves asked us for a phone when they saw us taking pictures and took a picture of us as a family together.
The turbulence was really minimal even in bad weather and landing went also smoothly.
I am definitely going to travel with this airline again :)
No need to worry, sometimes the Internet is not true or this airline has just recently improved a lot .. :)",7,"2019",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Budget all the way","Instead of flying Pegasus to go to Ephesus or Isparta in Anatolia (to see ancient Adada and lavender fields) from Istanbul, we flew return to Israel and back. It was a very basic airline service without inflight entertainment or food, unless prearranged through the online ticketing menu options. The baggage policies are very strict; any suitcase oversized or reaching 8 kg must be checked at $30 USD each. Thus, passengers need to account extra time at the airport, as the ticketing (ground handler) agents do not process payments; I had to go to another line inside the airport to pay for my baggage and then return to the ticket counter line-up. Even our carryon suitcases approved by Lufthansa and Air Canada or American Airlines were considered too big by Pegasus to travel; Pegasus’ website needs to be updated in terms of approved carryon bag dimensions. Only a handbag of 3 kg is permitted. Pegasus flights to/from Anatolia depart from Terminal 1 in Tel Aviv, and all their other flights are at the main Terminal #3. Gates and ticket counters are listed on screens, once inside the terminal. The flight attendants were fine with some knowledge of English. Food could only be purchased inflight with exact Euros in cash; it’s best to preorder online without upgrades, which were unnecessary. The odd thing is that only coffee or tea (no water) is complimentary, and they don’t give passengers paper napkins. Car rental returns were close to T1 (follow the orange signs) with a 5-10 minute shuttle to terminals. The shorthaul international flight was on time as scheduled but arrived at the old (SAW) airport in Istanbul, further from the city’s European and business centre. Our overall experience was better than prior travel on Air Egypt, but I would generally choose to fly Pegasus if no other good options were available.",7,"2019",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst airline","I understand this is a low cost airline but it doesnt mean they can be this bad. The staff are so so rude terrible service and no AC. There are WAY better low cost airlines out there they should learn from them. Worst customer experience ever",7,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","It worked","For price we tried stansted / Istanbul / dalaman and the same return. Good transfer times made the journey only 6-7 hours as opposed to 4 hours direct. The transfers were a bit hit and miss , but both successful. Our luggage arrived at both ends. Our seats were booked all the way through, didn’t check in on line - food ordered in advance and delivered. Downloaded films to our phone. Oblivious in general to all around us, we speak no turkish. More than happy , 1 hour delay on the return in Istanbul (bit frustrating, no real info, but.......",7,"2019",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Early Take off and Arrival","Always fly to Tel Aviv with Pegasus. Always seem to board nice and early, take off early and land early. Same on the way back. Funny to see and hear some passengers clapping as we took off as well as landing. Great service as Always.",7,"2019",5

There is scam going between these two companies as they trying to sell the flight that goes very early morning and there are less interest from passengers to fly at this time. When I contacted air travel agency, they said talk to Pegasus and Pegasus saying talk to Agency, and they are not willing to cancel or change the time. I will stay away from this airline for ever.",7,"2019",1

"Pegasus-Airlines","Pegasus Airlines","Other than the flight being extremely uncomfortable and the staff being rude and stuck up, every time my family and I use this airline before boarding they start doing this security check where they mostly pick hijabis and my mom is one and start to search her in a very uncomfortable way and they throw everything out of the bags and treated her multiple times disrespectfully. And in the process of them searching all hijabis and arab men the flight was delayed for a whole hour just because of that. And they even started letting people in the security check only 20 minutes before the take off of the flight. The turkish staff have no respect at all. They were extremely rude, disrespectful and I don't recommend anyone to use this airline.",7,"2019",1

"Pegasus-Airlines","Budget airline","This is truly a budget airline. Small seats, 1 class of service, no fills. Passengers put their over sized bags in the aisle instead of checking them in.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Hidden Prices Everywhere","It is a budget airline. The best with this airline is its young fleet. They fly more 'short haul' than long. On several occasions landings were more occasions hard than soft.

The boarding is always terrible and everyone goes after the other person. It is no exception though in Turkey. There is very little respect for boarding order.

If you are flying with a late flight (afternoon or evening) I found that you have more chances to be delayed as all delays of a particular aircraft, then, accumulated.

Inside comfort is not satisfactory, despite the new generation aircraft, the configuration is based on 'how to carry more passengers' . Legroom is not satisfactory.Seat distributions by 'computer' is coded to give you 'most troublesome seat'. It means you will likely to change your place by paying extra.

Until lately, this airline was accepting the seat adjustments during check in. Now they are charging even when you have a new seat at the moment of check in!

Another issue I noticed with this airline with another flight was stunning. Airline canceled my flight. Sure it can happen. Then proposes a new set up. When you say 'yes' you are asked to pay the difference of price, this is regardless that they are the one who canceled. If you say 'no', disaster. Then the answer 'take your money and go'. I didn't choose this flight six months ago to take my money back. What about my vacation plans in the office,hotel arrangements and all.

Even if you say 'yes' to the new arrangement, you have to pay ' calculated price in 'full' for new flight. Your funds paid 6 months ago for the canceled flight will be reimbursed when you indicate your bank account number later !

I guess this airline has management issues not technical. This is so good at the end.",7,"2019",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst airline and service !!","what started of as a good flight, turned into a mess.

I was told that as long as we kept proof of the flight details, we are fine to claim anytime.

1. Mid-level prices on international and domestic flights in Turkey. You can find cheap tickets for different days of the week.
2. Good planes, normal on-board service.
3. I had six flights this year without registered luggage. Pegasus has dimension and weight restrictions for cabin luggage, but my wasn’t measured at all!

Cons:
1. Poor online service. It took a lot of time to renew a booking PNR when I didn’t receive e-mail with it.
2. Sometimes flights are delayed.
3. Smartphone application is online and is totally useless without Internet connection.
4. Pin-codes for free Internet access in Turkish airports are not provided for Pegasus passengers.

I like the attitude, helpfulness of the cabin crew. Moderately priced wide variety of inflight snacks make the flight enjoyable. Most seats cost extra even any corridor or window. So unless you pay on a busy flight, you end up squeezed in the middle couch.",7,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","On time and exceptional Value","Flew with this airline for the first time and found it to be exceptionally good for a budget airline. The seat pitch was enough for my 6'3"" frame to sit comfortably. the food and beverage selection was quite adequate and the aircraft was clean and well presented.
The cabin staff were attentive during the flight.

The only issue I had which reduced my rating from 5 to 3, was on landing back at Stansted well before reaching the Terminal the Captain had to stop for a while on the taxiway and many of the passengers stood up and started taking down their bags from the overhead lockers. I had to shout at them to sit down as the aircraft was not yet at the stand. The Cabin staff were extremely slow to pick up on this as they were sitting behind a curtain and could not see down the cabin. I hope that this is picked up by their safety officer.",7,"2019",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Unfair charges for hand luggage","As I was transiting through Istanbul, a Pegasus attendant weighed my hand luggage bags. One weighed 11kg and the other 4kg. The Pegasus bag-measuring cage nearby clearly stated that passenges are allowed 1 bag weighing 8kg AND one other small bag. My one bag was therefore 3kg too heavy, but I was charged for 7kg, even though I saw her weigh other people's main hand luggage, but not their second one. Needless to say, I was livid, but decided to pay the fee (378 lira, which - at that time - was £51.99 GBP for 7kg) to avoid missing my plane.

Otherwise, Pegasus aren't too bad - this was my third flight with them, and the other two were fine.",7,"2019",2

The second was the same. i cant stand that tone of voice as if I am bothering them. Someone gotta tell them we are paying their salaries. I dont want to be rude but if you are not good at customer servuc, if you dont wanna help just dont do it. It took me 3 hours on the phone just to do a small change,4 different CS agencies. They were all so unwilling to help. There has been an issue with their system and it wasnt accepting my card and none of them tried to help me inanother way , they all hanged up saying ""sorry there is nothing I can do, call your bank"". Luckly last agency who picked up the phone such a good person at his job, and he helped me, he tried another way after 2 fails of the card and then it worked. So the problem wasnt with my card but with their system and none of them (except one) couldnt be bothered to give a proper service. They wasted my 3 hours and damaged my nerve system.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Unprofessional and rude staff","I have just experienced a very unprofessional and rude staff of Pegasus at Manchester airport. I am a finnish citizen and I do not need a visa to travel Turkey. But, when I went for check in over the counter. The rude lady told me that I need a visa to travel to Turkey. She told me to leave the queque and apply for a visa online. I said I do not need visa. She told me with strong voice that I need a visa. So, I left the queque and started to apply for visa online. I inserted my nationality and travel date and immediately the webisite says I do not need visa for 90 days. So, I went back to the lady with my computer open and told her politely that I was trying to apply for a visa but the website says I do not need visa. Then she quickly read the message on the website on my computer and told me wait a bit, very rude manner. After serving a customer from the queue she asked for my passport and started working to issue a boarding card for me. I politely told her that I am surprised to hear that I need a visa. She replied that everyone needs visa, you will need visa on arrival. I said yes but that is a different thing. She did not say sorry and no guilt on her face. She issued the boarding pass and handed it to me and I left. How ignorant a staff member would be to say me that I need a visa without even checking properly with her colleague or from other sources. Moroever, they have not learnt customer services at all. So unfortunate.",7,"2019",1

After checking in the bags and the baby strollers we noticed they did not give us check-in tags for the baby strollers. when we asked about the tags the check in staff said there is no need for the tags but we knew we needed the tags in case the strollers got lost, the staff got angry and asked us to move away from the counter without the giving us the tags. so we had no choice but to leave as the check in counter opened late and we were afraid we would miss the flight. To make it short we arrived to our destination and the strollers Unfortunately did not. 3 baby strollers worth more than $1000 is lost because of Rude unprofessional and disrespectful staff of Pegasus airlines. We kept following up with the Pegasus airlines lost and found department and we even complained about Pegasus airline to the Turkish embassy in Bahrain but without success.

"Pegasus-Airlines","The worst airline we ever used","I feel like people working for this airline only care about making profit (do they get bonuses for this?) and don't care about passengers' well-being what so ever.

Unfortunately, I had 2 trips from hell with this airline and as a result I will never use them again.

This was a connect flight from Russia to London. I booked it a long while back before I'd known I was pregnant, so the matters were made worse by the fact that I'm now 5 months pregnant.

To get to Moscow we flew using S7 airline from Irkutsk.... Two airlines are like night and day. S7 was a comfortable, clean plane with professional, organised and friendly staff. The same can not be said about Pegasus.

On our first flight from Moscow to Istanbul (5h10min) we sat in a dirty plane (fingerprints and snort on windows, dirty toilets, sellotaped table and a constant flicking light bulb above my seat) in a boiling temperature.

It was so hot I couldn't stop fanning myself for one minute and when I asked to buy water I was told that only dollars or euros were accepted, which I didn't have (roubles or pounds only). They wouldn't accept my debit card either, as they only take credit cards.

By the time we got to Istanbul I was so thirsty I though I would faint. How is this allowed?

While we were waiting for our second flight in the airport in Turkey we bought some chocolates and souvenirs. As it was a lot colder than in Russia (we were originally travelling from Siberia), we put our coats into our hang luggage so that we don't carry them around, the souvenirs were put there also. During boarding we were told that our hand luggage was 2kg over for which they wanted us to pay, so we ended up putting our coats back on and shoving chocolates into our pockets.... This may be a minor mishap but it added to the whole unpleasant experience dealing with the airline.

On the flight to London (4h) there were water issues again. This time not with me , but with the person sitting next to us who needed to take some medication. When he asked a member of staff for a bit of water, he was told that he had to buy a bottle. The man didn't have any dollars and they wouldn't accept a debit card so he had to pay with 50 Euro note to which they didn 't have change. The man ended up buying a lot of food that he didn't eat to just get that water. He was also shocked by the fact that you can't get water on this airline free of charge.

I think the only positive about flying with this airline is that it didn't crash. The whole experience was horrendous.",6,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Good Value for Budget Airline with no Frills","If you are a well traveled individual used to taking budget airlines then Pegasus would be a sensible choice. The airline staff onboard are not particularly engaging but offer a decent service and will try to help. Obviously try to buy something at the English airport that you can take onboard with you to eat as choices are limited and not very appetising but the seats are comfortable and the aircraft is clean. Luggage is 20kg for checking in and a 7kg online baggage which is not exactly policed so many people take a larger amount on board!! My flight took off on time and landed on time and was absolutely acceptable. On par with any budge airline. Had trouble checking in online in England but the queue was not extensive at Stansted and the airline desk was quick but in Istanbul I checked in online perfectly.",6,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst trip ever!","I really really need to warn any fellow passengers: avoid this airline. I had the worst trip, both going to Antalya and coming back. First: Ground staff, not speaking English at all except some basic words, couldn't explain the 2 hours delay for both sectors. On first sector we got into aircraft, captain said we'll leave in 5 minuo, then for 40 minutes we were on ground without any other explanation. Then going back from Antalya: Again delay, again no explanation, only a bottle of water or soft drink provided. I got into check in almost 3h beforehand anf they already knew the delay, couldn't they inform us? The cabin crew were kind, but the impression had already been ruined.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Couldn’t fault the service from start to finish","We booked an all Inclusive holiday package for 5 to Turkey through Lastmin.com (never again!!) well, they messed up our booking and confirmed only 4 of a party of 5 flights. We stayed on the phone for what seemed like days even while walking through the airport doors. The whole time the agent was saying, “ everything is booked, it’s fine and it’s normal” we were assured that the confirmation e-mail was on the way so we all went to the airport. It turns out at check in that my elderly fathers flight had not been booked, so we had a very traumatic hour trying to source another flight. Long story short...The manager and and supervisors went out of their way to help us and give us routes to try, they kept coming over to us to make sure my dad was ok. It wasn’t what we had planned but he arrived a couple of hours after us, BUT, he arrived. I couldn’t praise them enough, their care and empathy to our situation makes me rank their service as one of the best. They were exceptional, lastmin.com were abominable!!!!

The flight itself was roomy, clean and more than I expected from a relatively unknown brand, to me anyway. We took food with us but the choice for such a short flight was fine. The staff on the flight were friendly.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Budget service at non-budget prices!!!","I flew from Izmir to Barcelona with a transit at Istanbul Sabiha Gokcen airport. I paid for my meal from Izmir to Istanbul and during check in I was asked if I want to take the earlier flight to Istanbul (since I was there earlier than my flight). I said it doesn't matter for me so they switched me to an earlier flight. To my surprise, I was not provided with the meal I paid for at my flight. When I asked the cabin crew about my meal, they referred me to their cabin crew manager and the manager said there was no meal provided for me in that flight. She said she will check again what she can do and get back to me but the whole time she was having a very bad attitude towards me.

The meal service ends but still there is not even a word from her. I walk to the back of the plane, find her and ask what happened with my meal and she says sorry she cannot give me my meal. She doesn't get back to me and she doesn't even offer to sell me the meal!! She said Pegasus will pay me back for the meal, even though I tell her that this is not about the money I paid but about me getting my meal since I had to take my medication..

Terrible service. And in the end Pegasus did not pay me back for the meal! I wouldn't recommend Pegasus to anyone unless they have no other option! Their cabin crew look very inexperienced and their cabin crew manager was horrible at best with her attitude.

Stay away! My next flight, I found a much cheaper ticket from a non-budget European airlines; one that has more legroom, entertainment, food and more luggage allowance!! So remember Pegasus is not always the cheapest!",6,"2019",1

"Pegasus-Airlines","Good flight, if you like paying extra for everything...","Had a comfortable enough flight, but do be aware, this budget carrier will ensure they squeeze you for anything they can.

As we boarded, we were quickly swarmed by 2 agents to weigh our bags before we got on the plane. Frankly we were sitting right in-front of the booth for 30 minutes waiting for the flight, so not sure why they felt they had to sneak up on us as we were boarding which was annoying in the jet bridge. But since we are honest Canadians, we had pre-paid for the baggage allowance and were released after being in the way for a few minutes.

Then on the plane to sit together we also paid extra and it came with a sandwich, but no drinks - which were 6Euros for a cup of sprite and water!! LOL - seriously. In-air robbery! But, whatever, the flight was reasonably priced so I guess they have to make up for it elsewhere. Just be sure you know all these things before going on etc.

The plane was clean and the staff were good otherwise, so more of a 3.5, but I went with a 3 for the gouging cost of the pop...",6,"2019",3

"Pegasus-Airlines","Any airline but Pegasus","First of all, we travel a lot, we are really flexible people and have endured crazy things, but THIS TAKES THE CAKE! Ok, not many people fly from Prishtina, Kosovo to Tel aviv granted! Our original flight was going to have an 8 hr. layover in SAM Istanbul. Ok, not great but we will go with it! A week before the flight we were notified that our connecting flight was cancelled and we would have a 12 hour layover, again not great but we can read and surely they will at least give us a meal at the airport!
We arrived that early morning in Istanbul found the Starbucks and had a coffee, then I headed out to find the Pegasus office and ask about our rights. The booth was empty, so I thought this is my chance to get some steps in, by taking a stroll, every ten minutes I looped around and the booth was still empty. I asked at the other booths, shoulder shrugs!! I made a few more loops and finally a guy in the booth who didn't speak English, pointing for me to go downstairs where we had arrived! After literally fighting with security guy to get to the transfer desk, I was met with a lady that just looked at me like I had just escaped from the asylm! No...No
...we don't do that...Maybe I should explain again that it was on the webpage what are passengers rights for a 12 hour layover, (I would have pulled it up on my phone but there is no internet in this Airport!) I took a deep breath and asked for her supervisor...an amazing thin, long haired young lady greeted me with a smile and asked how she could help (this was not the supervisor, though she should be). I explained again, she made some calls, she called again, finally some one arrived and didn't even address me and said a few things to her. She called again. Finally and with much shame, she said, this is the best I can do for you. Two meals from Burger King, what about internet? NO! (I had to laugh, it was better than crying...I cannot eat Burger King, but my hubby will eat my meal...Happy 30th Babe! When our stomachs began to growl, we headed to Burger KIng, thinking maybe I could get a salad, we arrived with our handwritten note, he had to make a call, 5 minutes later he said, Ok, you can order a chicken fingers or a Jr. Cheese burger meal....what about a salad, oh no, that's not available to you. Again sometimes you just gotta laugh! We went to the only restuarant in the airport that offered one hour internet if you bought a meal, we ordered amazing food and enjoyed the internet for an hour. The Caribou coffee shop had couches, so we got a coffee and took a nap, read, walked, and finally the gate appeared for our flight! There was a defect and there would be a one hour delay. Ok, my hubby ate the Burger King since we were approaching 14 hours in the airport! I remembered when trying to get my steps in early on our arrival, that I had stopped in the lounge, thinking they could help since my booth dude was AWAL, and the guy said, ""OH Pegasus, it would be better for you to go to the Police and fight for your rights, Really?"" My mistake that I didn't take this guy seriously! You gotta understand this was a bucketlist trip for our 30th wedding anniversary, we were trying to save money on the flight so we could enjoy our time in Israel. WE WILL NEVER FLY PEGASUS AGAIN, EVEN IF WE HAVE TO TAKE AN EXTRA FLIGHT TO GET WHERE WE ARE GOING!",6,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Cheap fight to Istanbul...","I flew to Istanbul from Marseille and the way back as well.
Very cheap flight, only 84 €uros.
I just had a bag with me (less than 8 kilos), I didn't book any seat or food and drinks.
The flight was about 2 hours 45 minutes and I could change seat in order to have a window one, because the plane was not full!
The views over the Princes Islands were absolutely amazing!",6,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst VFM airline","Flew with them from Istanbul to London. They changed the departure gate without making a clear announcement till quite late. No entertainment or food, which was to be expected, but the seats were the most uncomfortable of any budget airline I’ve ever been on. When we arrived they didn’t bring an air bridge for about 20 minutes and our luggage didn’t arrive until an hour and a bit after getting through passport control. Cheap but still not quite value for money.",6,"2019",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Reliable, basic airline","Ive flown Pegasus a few times and havent had any issues. This airline is great for trips with only a backpack and a small carryon. Staff is friendly and Ive always had on-time flights. I would recommend as a low-cost alternative to the major carriers.",5,"2019",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Great flights","After reading many reviews I was quite anxious about our recent flights to and from Dalaman. However I cannot find any reason to fault the service in any way. The staff were polite and smartly dressed and the plane was comfortable both ways the only downside if it really is was the check in time at Dalaman was very drawn out I would definitely fly with Pegasus again and they offer great value for money",5,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Pegasus Give My Monet Back !!!","We bought ticket from Pegasus Airlines for my mother and my little son ( 15 months old) . I sent email for learning travel rules for traveling without parents. They gave me answer before few our earlier from boarding time. But there is no clear answer for my question and we called their customer service. The said ""you need document for baby"". so we had to cancel our travel, we went notary for document. We bought last minute ticket again for travel. And we learned they do not look this documents in local flights , they need them for international flights. I paid a lot of money because of their fault. Nobody looked our notary document for baby travelling. I lost a lot of money because of their wrongs. Pegasus Airlines must give my money back.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Better than expected","I was quite worried reading the reviews considering I was travelling with my child. Pegasus flies every day from london Stansted to Istanbul SAW at around midnight. The flight to leave before this is at 10 pm so that means by the time you reach the airport around 9:30, you are the only people in the entire airport to board a flight which makes the check in and security a breeze. The The gates opened on time and the flight left exactly on time. There was very less interaction on the flight. i had already got water filled from one of the restaurants considering the steep price for buying water on board. The crew was very nice. I had a few drinks on board . they charged in turkish lira were moderately priced. The seats dont recline so it can be a problem sleeping. The leg space is just ok but there are no pockets to keep stuff. I didn't eat anything on board s cant comment on the food I would at least highly recommend this midnight flight",5,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Cheap airlines, poor service","Flight from Berlin to Erzurum with a stopover in Istanbul. Lost baggage with skiing equipment, another bag totally damaged. Nobody could speak English in Erzurum so we could not get any information on how to deal with those problems. We had to collect the skiing equipment by ourselves from the airport after 5 days of waiting. The flight back delayed for over 6 hours so we missed our next flight from Istanbul to Berlin. Had to spend 1 night in Istanbul. Of course the airlines paid for the hotel but it took a few hours of going from one counter to another and trying to communicate with the stuff barely speaking English. Generally the stuff is quite rude and not willing to help in emergency situations. Our final flight was also late about 1 hour so we missed our transport to our home city.
I was mailing with Pegasus for almost 3 months to receive refund for the broken baggage and the money we had to spend on skiing equipment. The number of ridiculous documents they wanted me to send them was just incredible but I did not give up and managed to get some refund. It did not cover all of my costs but still it was something.
So generally, next time I will have an offer to fly with Pegasus Airlines, I will think twice whether to do it or not.",5,"2019",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","60 pounds to change flight with fully paid, ""flexible"" ticket!","I paid etra for a ""flexible"" ticket; one that I could change flights without additional costs. When I tried to change I was told that there would be a fee of 60 pounds, incredibly BECAUSE I had a flexible ticket. If I had not had a flexible ticket, I was told - several times! - that the change would have been free. The agent acknowledged that this was a very poor arrangement, but said, apologetically, that, alas, it was that way!

Apart from that, it is not a bad budget airline: flights run on time, appear well organized, and with seemingly well maintained planes.",5,"2019",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Top of the cheap airlines","I'd never heard of Pegasus airline until booking a cheap last minute holiday to Turkey so was a bit apprehensive, for no reason, it turns out.

Return flights for 2 during May half term cost £441, 8pm flight out, 4pm flight back, with the usual pre-book seats for a small fee. We'll worth it.

It was a shame they only had 3 check-in desks open for a full flight, it took over an hour, which didn't leave enough time to enjoy a leisurely meal before the flight.

That was the only downside to the flight out and wide comfy seats, polite cabin crew, 2 opportunities for on flight refreshments and bespoke in-flight entertainment for £2 more than made up for it.",5,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Lost baggage","I flew from Ankara to jeddah with a transit at Istanbul for 7 hours but when I reached Jeddah I didn’t receive my luggage. Not to mention how uncomfortable the flight was and the delay time was just terrible",5,"2019",1

On time no delays.some other low cost airlines should learn from Pegasus.",5,"2019",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Low cost airline operating from Istanbul Sabiha Gokcen","Pegasus is a low cost airline operating mainly from Istanbul Sabiha Gokcen airport on the Asian side of Istanbul. It is large airport with many different means of transportation and also at least 3 car parks.
Pegasus doesn’t offer free catering but you can pay beforehand and order food or buy it during the flight.

The airplanes are quite new and well maintained. However the seat pitch can be very narrow in some airplanes. The flight from Istanbul to Bologna was a comfortable one but the airplane from Bologna to Istanbul ( named Derya) had an unacceptably narrow seat pitch. Prices are generally more reasonable than its competitors.",5,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Good services in the economy section","Quite an economical option to travel abroad. Good ground services with adequate in flight support. The seats are a bit uncomfortable as they dont recline, but not a bad option to travel as it doesnt punch a hole into your pocket.",5,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Price-worthy...THATS IT!","My husband and I booked with this airline as others were a bit pricey. Very nice and pleasant staff.Always willing to help. We were alloted middle and aisle seats almost throughout the whole flight. Not too much foot room but it worked. Food for sale on board. Annoncements, boarding, transportation to the plane was smoothe. Bathrooms on board were clean throughout the flight. Thank you Pegasus! Am sure we will use ths airline again :)",5,"2019",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Just another low cost carrier","Nothing over average. best to stock up on food before the flight as the options are limited. otherwise clean, neat and comfortable",5,"2019",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Dovolena","I was going to Dubai for 2nd time. I usually dont use any low cost airlines, just this time. I have to say that i have never seen such unpolite crew and service. During all the flights was horrible air and hot inside. By one flight we needed to change the plane because AC didt work. We were asking some water during our flight back, crew ignored us and played with tablet. I dont want to travel like that more than 5 hours. Not recommended",5,"2019",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Could Not Even BUY Ticket Online or on Phone with a Mastercard!","Unbelievable experience trying to book and purchase a flight. Once I had all of the information in and the flights I wanted, the system would not let me buy (and thus reserve) my flight. When I called, they said I had to use a different device, which I did - starting the process all over. When I called again and said, ""Can I pay on the phone?"" they were going to charge me and extra $30! What the...? Finally, I gave up and went with another airline, even though it was more expensive. I figured, well if they can't handle me buying the flight, they're not going to do well at the flight itself.",5,"2019",1

"Pegasus-Airlines","Mobility device battery for disabled confiscated illegally","My son who uses a wheelchair and an attached mobility device flew 4,flights with Pegasus to Barcelona and back to Tel Aviv through Istanbul. Their employee , Erdem Ketenci, confiscated the battery before the last flight and refused to give a receipt . My son, Arnon Amit has received no answers to his complaints and certainly not his expensive battery, and cannot use his very helpful mobility device. This was a horrible frustrating demeaning experience for any passenger especially for one who requires a wheelchair because of a spinal cord injury. If the battery did not fit their regulations they should have informed him before the first flight and he would have left it at the airport in Tel Aviv . To suddenly confiscate it 5 min . before boarding a 4th flight with Pegasus was criminal as was refusing a receipt for this expensive battery.",5,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Damaged luggage","My new suitcase got damaged on the first flight I used it for, flying with Pegasus Airlines. I reported it when I got home in September 2018. It is now May 2019I sent in all the information they asked for...then nothing happened. I have e-mailed customer service and they apologise and then ask me to send the information again..and then nothing happens. This has gone on for 8 months. I have a feeling they have no intention of compensating me for the suitcase they damaged. I'll never fly with them again.",5,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","I love Pegasus Airlines","Seriously I’ve always had good experiences with this airline. Prices are so much cheaper thn the national airline and tickets have options to be fully flexible for a small amount. Peace of mind and easy to use app. Couldn’t recommend it more.",5,"2019",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Pain in my back after three hours in these seats","As a pre-caution I paid 18 euros extra to have an exit row seating. That was a good choice with my length, because at these seats I nearly just fitted in. A normal seat would have been definitely way too small. I wouldn't recommend this airline when you are a tall person. The seats were extremely hard and my back was aching afterwards. Customerservice on board? Well, I didn't get any service on board!",5,"2019",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Great Airline","Check in was very fast and the staff were helpful. The legroom was very wide, my husband has long legs and usually struggles with his legs but the space was very good. We flew for 4 hours and my husband was able to stretch his legs. There was no in flight entertainment but I didnt expect to have any due to the short flight. We pre ordered our sandwich which was ok but not the best.",5,"2019",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Convenient","When traveling in or to and from Turkey do not forget to check this airline for different and more convenient flights to your destination, It is a one class of service airline, you pay for everything including water, seat selection etc. Budget airline with sufficient leg room for short flights. Although it is absurd that yuo can not even have water free, they do not charge for the use of WC. I am sure they will find a way to do that as well someday..",5,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","I'll never fly Pegasus again.","Sardines, stuffed in like sardines. That's an accurate description of the cramped quarters we endured on our flight from Rotterdam to Instanbul and back. The attendants cruised the aisles trying to sell food and duty free items. I've flown other low fare airlines but this one is the worst.",5,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","on time","it was a pleasant flight, It was on time and staff were helpful. They should offer water at least. Prices of beverages are a bit high.",5,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Not good for long distance flying","Absolutely terrible airline. I initially booked based on price, however after all the add ons which you have to pay for such as extra baggage, in flight meals... it worked out more than it would have to take a direct flight with Emirates. The seats are extremely uncomfortable and do not recline, very little leg room. I would only advise to use this airline for very short trips which would be bearable for 2 or 3 hours. On a plus side, the £12 I paid for the veal steak was very impressive for airline food.",5,"2019",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Very bad service!","- 5 hours 21 minutes delay
- no information on airport displays 1 hour !after! planned departure
- no staff at gate to inform passengers
- wrong information from sales staff (prevented re-routing which would have saved me 1 hour 30 minutes)
- customer relations denies any compensation what so ever

*Very* big disappointment!",5,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Very friendly staff","I am writing this on behalf of my mum who landed on 2/5/19 and insisted me to leave a review first time ever!

She found the staff/crew extremely thougtful of her and that they went above and beyond their way to support her from begening till the end of her journey.

This isnt the way of I personally expreince pegasus myself but good to see things are changing. Hope their strict rules and customer service will get even better.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Just awful Service","We booked flights with this company for our winter vacation from Istanbul to Antalya and back. And even though this was a domestic flight, we arrived 3 hours in advance to Sabina Gokcen Airport to register our bags. First surprise came when we saw a huge line of passengers (please see photo attached) in line, but we thought there are still 3 hours so they probably know what they're doing. Hour later we realized that apparently they put all passengers for all Pegasus flights throughout the country in one line (not a joke). Hour left for departure and we are not even in the middle of the line and that's where we start getting really nervous. I left my relatives in line and went to get a hold of someone, but registering counter attendants simply said to me ""Go talk to Supervisor at Aisle # "". Supervisor is a young boy in his early 20th with extremely arrogant attitude. After I was able to get through to him and asked whether we are going to be on time for our flight? He replied ""maybe"" and did not even want to help, and instead was implying that we should have arrived earlier for our registration. Shockingly, I told him that we were in line for the past 3 hours but instead he was laughing and making fun of our situation in Turkish language with his colleagues. That's how unprofessional they are. Long story short, we did not make it to our original departure flight and they made us to buy new tickets to another flight in 4 hours. $500 additionally spent and so much frustration.",4,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","No comfort, slow reaction re complaints","Check in was good, due to 3rd party ground personell. The rest of this trip was less than good. No comfort, no service on the plane. Bad connection in Istanbul. And difficult refunding process.",4,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Lost Baggage on a direct flight and never compensated","Flew with this carrier during the winter holiday season.
They lost my baggage on a direct flight and did not reimburse me for costs incurred during the time I had no luggage. They lied and said they would for sure find the luggage and return it, no one ever called to give me updates, I was the one to always call. After luggage went to collections they wanted a detailed report of luggage contents and estimated value. This was provided and a rediculously low amount was proposed which I then refused. Since then no news and they closed my case and never responded to my emails. Horrible Guest Relations service and they are liars. Don't ever fly with them during holiday seasons because you can be sure that your luggage will be most likely stolen. How can you lose a luggage on a direct flight from Geneva to Istanbul?!",4,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","no matter what your options are never pick this airline. it's a nightmare","checking in was a nightmare they made us late on purpose because its an overbooked flight despite the fact that we came to the airport 3 hours earlier than the flight. and gate closed before the actual opening time, horrible customer service they kept us at the airport for over 19 hours because there werent any other flights and we werent allowed to leave the airport. there wasnt any place to actually sit or rest in the airport. we were a family og 6 including 2 children and the experience ruined the whole trip for us. we had work and as a university student i had submissions to submit the next day so this made things worse. their service and customer care is so terrible and disrespectful. we ended up leaving the country with a different airline and we did not get a refund or compensation for what happened all we got was bad treatment because of their overbooked flight and terrifying customer service. no matter what your options are never pick this airline.",4,"2019",1

And nobody helped me. no new tickets to buy.",4,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","A wingless flying horse..","This low cost flight started already on the wrong foot..In spite of being booked few months in advance, as the connection flight from Tel Aviv, with advertised connection time of one and a half hours, we have been advised by the airline at least a month and a half prior departure date that the connection time will be five hours.. How did the airline know that so early- simply because apparently they never meant it to be the short connection advertised, but only as a sales ploy..An airline who tries to lure passengers with fake connection time can't be trusted. period. Nothing much can be said about the flight itself which was ordinary, without anything offered, even water to the passengers, true to its low cost category. The landing itself , in pretty nice weather was a rough one. After flying hundreds of commercial flights on numerous airline over five decades can definitely distinguish between a ""normal"" landing and the one we had on this flight at Amsterdam airport. Thought the ""experience"" was over? think again. One of the suitcases of my sister-in-law didn't arrive.. As there is no Pegasus representative at the airport, it took some time with the airport officials to register the non-arrival.. it took another three days until it finally was brought to the hotel. Naturally, we don't plan to fly with this airline any time soon..",4,"2019",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst airlines ever","This is the worst airlines ever, i would suggest never to travel via pegasus. The staff is so unfriendly, so rude, does not cooperate for even a kilo of luggage. The worst airlines i have ever travelled throughout my life. Bus would be better",4,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Never Again","Will not fly with Pegasus ever again. Made the huge mistake of flying on Pegasus for the first time on a long haul flight from London Stansted to Istanbul to Jeddah. The aeroplanes are very small and incredibly noisy. This was one of the very few flights were we all suffered from cabin pressure ear aches quite badly. The staff are not the friendliest to say the least. They seem more concerned with running an overpriced shop in the sky. You do not get anything, not even a bag of peanuts without having to pay inflated prices. One cannot even get a glass of water without having to pay for it! The legroom was awful. I know this is a budget airline stripped back to save money but this was ridiculous. I was half expecting to have to make my own seat before I could sit down.Do yourself a huge favour and fly with almost anyone else but Pegasus.",4,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Good Priced Airline","A good flight was had both ways at a good price, in flight staff good and helpful, second time we used Pegasus in a month the other flight Istanbul to Amsterdam excellent for the price comfortable and inclusive of a meal,not many airlines provide meals on a three and half hour flight, the shorter flight no meal; but not to be expected. Will be travelling again with Pegasus and would recommend.",4,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Turkey Visit","We choose Pegasus Airline for our trip to Turkey from Muscat. The rates are good but the service was not ok. We had booked our food while booking the flight however it seems it was not intimated to the airlines and we where not served food.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Great Airline","I’ve been in Turkey for two weeks, usually I’m a bus kinda girl but looking at the distances and being time poor, I’ve flown. I’ve taken 4 flights with these guys in two weeks, always good. Easy to book. Can check in online days before and send mobile pass to Apple wallet. On time, fine aircraft,clean, good cabin staff and if you opt for the meal option the feta roll is tasty. Check in is a breeze too. All destinations I’ve been to have well organised transit service too. I ❤️ 🇹🇷",4,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Cheap deal","Pegasus is cheap segment airlines. So it offers the cheapest price in its destinations.
But you should have exact planning to use as cheap.
If you want to buy food plan it before the flight and buy it. It will be 25% cheaper.
Also it is the same for extra luggage.
Technologically they are the fastest.
They mainly fly from istanbul to turkey, europe and middle east.
For connections check iwhich airport you have the connection.
The 2 airports in istanbul are 60 km away from each other and there is no direct connection ezcept taxi which will cost you about 50-70 usd and mıre than 2 hours depending on the traffic.
Mostly they are on time ar departures and arrivals.
But be aware that 30 minutes before the departure they start announcing last call for pegasus flights",4,"2019",4

At the counter where the woman needed to give the boarding pass... she was really rude! I finally arrived at the 204A gate and waited for the airplane until it was 10 when it turned out. I arrived at the place where two people were checking my check. They were very badly handicrafts! Things I had taken with me I needed to give them OR they take it from me and say that I have to give them 100€ and if I didn't they wouldn't allow me to fly. Since I'm an American, they thought I'm rich. That was the second time that I flew on pegasus airlines. They said that either I pay 100€ for my 3kg stuff or I needed to give them my stuff OR I'M NOT ALLOWED TO FLY! That day I did not have the 100€ so I couldn't pay for it. That was the second but last time that I had flown on pegasus airlines. I'd prefer to be treated like a normal human being than being treated like a wild animal.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Pegasus worst experience ever","I would like to share my flight experience with Pegasus. I booked a flight from Bahrain to Istanbul flight number PC825 and PC824 this was my first flight with this airline and hopefully will be the last one.

All I can tell you that traveling with this airline is a nightmare from the plane to the crew and staffs. A passenger was arrested in the first flight as he was opening the passengers bags and stealing money and stuff.. this was the first incident.

Coming back home was a real nightmare, first let me tell you that it was all planned in from the time you step down in the airport by all the staffs working for this airline and to be honest it’s like a Mafia planning to steal your money in anyway they can.. they asked me to go to a counter and finish my check in faster with 10$ per person saying that I’m running late but in fact I was there 3 hours before my flight and the trick is they have a multiple counters for Pegasus for all flights so it looks like it’s too busy and you will miss the flight for real..

After waiting for 40 minutes they asked me to pay for 3 Kilos extra but to funny part that this 3 kilos is for 4 bags and the trick here again they keep you in the line so you get panic that you might miss you flight. I booked a business flex so I have 12 KG for carry on bags and 20 KG for check in bags so I decided to pay the extra fees.

As I said in the beginning it’s all planned from the time you entered the airport they will not weight your carry in bag here so you get your boarding and get into the airport waiting for your boarding call.. again one of the mafia staff waiting at the gate weighting the carry on bags for last time so you don’t have any other choice other than paying this beggar.

Finally the experience was literally dealing with a mafia group and a bunch of beggars.",4,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","budget is budget","budget ist budget. so no surprise to pay extra for everything else than a seat, which is the minimum distance.
board entertainment is available in some planes with own equipment and on-board wifi.

the real problem are long stop-overs at Sabiha Gokcen Airport in Istanbul. The airport offers WiFi for 60 min only if you pay for a meal of 40 TL. Finding a seat to wait or sleep is impossible in the morning hours. Long waiting lines for the security check after you landed.",4,"2019",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Expecting a nightmare - got a pretty good experience","After reading all of these reviews, I was fully expecting that I was in a for a nightmare trip. The experience couldn't be further from the truth. Got to the airport and I was still confused by the Pegasus baggage policy. Everything I read said one piece of carry on luggage, sized similarly to a personal item. I thought I was going to have to check my rollaboard and with a 50lb limit, pay extra. But before even getting on the line to see what the story was, I was asked by a Lion Air employee if I needed help. I ask about the baggage (again, I was toting a medium-sized duffel and a US regulation size roll aboard . The rollaboard was def more than 50 lbs). The LA employee says ""no problem, you can take those aboard"". He was professional and friendly and pointed us to passport control. I was expecting SAW to be a nightmare as it was the same day that IST was moving locations. They had a warning on their site about more traffic than usual and to show 3 hours prior to the flight. No need, however, as we were through PP control and security in about 20 minutes. Got to spend a little extra time in the lounge so all good. We did almost miss our flight as we were focused on the wine and almost missed the last call but that a whole other story. Ran to the gate, took the shuttle to the plane (shuttle was CRAZy crowded but it was 2 minutes of my life so no complaints). The plane was pretty standard fare for a budget airline. Legroom: maybe a little cramped. Seat: Maybe a little hard. Water and food: maybe a little missing . However, this is a BUDGET airline. Know what to expect and you will be perfectly fine for a short haul flight. Staff was friendly and professional. Departure and arrival on time. Boarding easy and non-chaotic. All good! If you are stressing after reading all of the previous reviews like I was, you can relax. It's probably going to be a pretty normal flight experience :)",4,"2019",5

We had a very racist incident, with aggression, with one of the counter employees. The police had to interfere, the airline never apologized, even we wrote a formal complain....",4,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Delay and bad domestic airplanes","Always have some sort of delay. The domestic flights are terrible. It is cheaper thu compared to Turkish airline.",4,"2019",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Cheap flight, everything ok","Flight was ok, more or less on time, service was good. I can recommend this airline for budget travellers.",4,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Cramped seats","Granted it was a low cost airline, but it was fairly difficult to sit though I am not tall. I shudder to think what would be my state if I had travelled to a destination involving a longer flight.
On the plus side, the timing was brilliant. I reached Istanbul early in the morning, had a full day to go around the city on the same day as I was sleeping due to the timing of the flight.",4,"2019",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Basic but excellent","I like flypgs a lot because you don’t pay for unnecessary things. Compared to the very affordable prices, the airline is excellent. Planes are in good shape and you can really travel on a budget. Strongly recommend it.",4,"2019",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Cheap flight and not to uncomfortable for short flights","We flew over to Israel with Easyjet for a modest price but it quadrupled for return so we got tickets on Pegasus Airlines and it was fine. There seemed to be a lot of restrictions on luggage weight but they never weighed anything. Nothing to eat for free but lots for sale.",4,"2019",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","they fly anything","lack of interest from the onboard crew, allowing people to just do what ever they feel like while instruction light are on, safetybelts on, and still standing up, picking there handluggage from the overtop racks, walking around when the plain has landed and the safetybelts lights are still on, very annoing",4,"2019",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Arrived with one damaged baggage and the second suitcase was misplaced!!!","Horrible handling of luggage by Pegasus Airlines. My expensive Samsonite suitcase came completely damaged. The second suitcase was misplaced during the connecting flight for which I had to take the next day off to receive it by courier! There was no intimation of the delivery time! Also on following up with Pegasus Airlines about the damaged suitcase, all I got was a compensation of 57€! Little do they realise that I have to buy a new Samsonite suitcase which is nothing less than 300€!!! Ridiculous customer service and unapologetic email correspondence leaving a very bad experience for me with Pegasus Airlines. I will never fly with them again.",4,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst overweight management EVER!!!","We book our flights from Madrid to Hurghada, with connection in Istambul. In our first flight I had some overweight in my luggage, but the guy in the counters in Madrid told us that there wasn’t any problem, because we checked in another luggage that was underweighted and between both of them we just had a couple of extra kilos. The problem came in the way back, in Hurghada airport, where the guy (that was a bit overcame by the situation) told me that I had to pay for 5 extra kg 85 EUR. I told him that I didn’t understand why in the first flight there wasn’t any problem and this time there was. He called the supervisor and made us wait for 45 minuts. If I had known that it could be a problem in my way back, I would pay for a 30 kg luggage instead of 20 IN FIRST PLACE, but so they told us in the first flight it wasn’t a problem I didn’t do anything. So after 45 minutos, and after the guy had told us that it wasn’t neccesary to open our luggage, that he would compensate the weight, they made us pass 5 kilos from my luggage to my friend’s luggage... EVEN WHEN MINE WAS WRAPPED! So I needed to unwrappe it and they didn’t allow me to wrappe it again. I had very expensive diving material in my luggage and I was affraid I could lose something. Finally, when we weighted our luggage again they just exceed the weight for 2 kilos instead of 5, but they made me pay for 5. I sued to this company back in Spain and I hope they will give me my money back as soon as possible. Of course, I will never recomind to anyone to use their service and I will never use it again. I recomind to them to train better to their employs and unify criteria for a better guests service.",4,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Very unprofessional","Very bad airline no service no professionality. In friendly. Very bad English language. No care for costumer rights.",3,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Denied boarding","I have a residency card but they asked me for shingen visa! They did not refund my ticket. They are terrible airline. No service no hot line.",3,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Pegasus","The airline is ok. In time, with the possibility of online check-in to avoid the lines in the airport (if you don't have luggage).
The bad thing is they don't serve water. Any other airline i tried serves water for free and the extras for money. But not Pegasus. For a little battle (0,33) they want 1.50€. Normally bottle of water (0.5) in Istanbul is about 0.15€. No proportions.",3,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","always almost on time","excellent service! almost always in time. even if we didnt have any food or drinks in our flight it was ok and smooth.",3,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Full instant refund","I very stupidly booked the same flight three times - errors with my downloads as I was changing currencies - I immediately went to the ""My trips"" section and (surprisingly) there was a cancel trip button online, this is very rare. Wherever I've dealt with cleartrip or expedia they make it very difficult to get a refund. Anyways, I cancelled and they refunded all three flights within 3 days so I was well impressed - PLUS, someone picked up the phone in their Dubai office to confirm the cancelation...very rare good service- I'm much more inclined to book with them again now!",3,"2019",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","if it wasnt for the good fares i'd use an alternative airline - staff 90% rude","We've travelled twice on Pegasus Airlines and if it wasn't for the air fares we'd travel an alternative airline. We booked business fare and the only good thing about it is the extra cabin baggage allowance and the flexibility to change or cancel your flights.
Check in at Stansted was good because we got a great female who was friendly an efficient at her job. But listening to the other check in desk the girls were abrupt and rude to the passengers.
There no structure to boarding and even thou you pay extra to select your seat - its a free for all to get on the plane because there's very limited cabin baggage space for travellers.
Our flight had very helpful stewards and they were attention, but you could tell they were under pressure to get things done to a tight schedule.

All in all as I said we'd use them again because of price - not for the ground handling but for the on board crew.
WE had called the reservations team because they'd change our flight and the reservations staff we're rude and not really helpful - the attitude was do you want to cancel not offering alternatives unless you asked for them.
If they can get the ground handling sorted improve reservations then they are on to a winner.",3,"2019",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Excellent service","What I don't understand is why the stewardess insist on closing the curtains when stacking up trolleys, which is very often and takes a long time causing ques in the aisle!! Apart from that,very friendly and helpful team.",3,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Respects time of departure","I travelled to & from istanbul to kayseri, pegasus was on time, no delays in departure, arrival 5-10 minutes earlier, for domestic connection in turkey, i will suggest pegasus to all",3,"2019",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Good value for money","I had a flight through Istanbul, everything went smooth without any problem. A bit of a surprise for a low cost travel :)",3,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Pegasus Using Dirty Trick If you want to buy Flexible Ticket","It happened to me a few days ago when I purchased the flexible ticket for 16 April. Today, I wanted to change it to 5 April. They charge me with almost half of the original price mentioning that I pay for the difference. However, the normal ticket on 5 April costs almost similar to my original ticket purchased on 16. So the difference should be zero amount! It turns out that they don't offer the same price if you have a flexible ticket. This is their dirty trick! If you have a flexible ticket they intentionally increase the price so that you don't have any other option! Even I had to call their agency to change the date for me since in their online website only BASIC option with 8 kg can be selected for flexible mode and you cannot choose different option! So be careful do not pay extra for the flexible ticket all is marketing for them! At least I had this bad experience!
Very Bad Pegasus!!!",3,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Very unfriendly and unhelpful staff","We came at time discovered that they changed the plain and even though we paid extra money to choose our seats when we bought the tickets they put us at the back of the plain.
We finished every thing on time and pass the final security check at the gate.
Then one of the Pegasus staff members on the gate announced on the microphone that the trip will be delayed for minimun one hour.
The problem is that when you enter the check up in the gate you have no access to W.C and the AC was weak and there were lots of people waiting. So we asked this staff member can we go with the baby out and come back to do a security check again?he said yes .we asked are you sure the plain will be late for minimun one hour ?!! So if we go for half an hour and come back it will be ok ? He said yes sure.
We went for half an hour but when we came back there was no one ,no one to ask about what happened and no plain.... they did not call us by names or announced the last call!!!!
We are with a baby that doesn't have enough food or diapers!no bags too.
We went to the Pegasus office to ask what happened ,they let us wait another 0.5 hour for someone to come.
when this someone came she was not kind and said sorry we had no place for you on the plain today so you have to ask our office outside if they can find you a plan maybe tomorrow .
Guess what?!
They canceled our trip did not refund us anything and lead us to go back as if we entered Istanbul again.with a security agent and a Pegasus member not showing any empathy or sympaty to us or the baby.
They are not kind at all.
When we get out we went to pagasus and found a flight the next day we had to pay a full ticket again and it was expensive and we had to stay another day on the airport hotel on our expense.
I can not recommend Pegasus airlines to anyone",3,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worth it on a budget","I needed to travel for the lowest possible fare to Dubai on a social visit. Pegasus offered this for the barest minimum possible which was sufficient for my needs. Just be prepared for a long wait in Istanbul for the connection either direction. The seats are comfortable, clean facilities and the staff are friendly. For the cheapest package on offer, I was allowed to take on board only 1 piece of luggage up to 8kg. This worked out well as I was going for less than a week. I don’t include any food with my booking but you can get this for anywhere from £6 equivalent on the plane. Debit cards aren’t taken so you’ll need cash or a credit card. I did not experience any delays on any of the 4 flights taken for this trip. I recommend Pegasus for those who are on a tight budget or backpackers and willing to travel slightly rough for a few hours",3,"2019",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","not bad but need some improvements","First of all if you are tall the seat legroom will be a problem if you do not book the Exit Row. For my husband flight I ordered and paid in advance the chicken leg with rise meal but once he was in the plane the crew asked him when he did the food purchase because they do not have him in the list. It was very interesting to hear this as long the meal payment was done ahead of time and the meal type was mentioned on his ticket.",3,"2019",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","all on time, efficient","For a budget airline, I don't think you can knock it. Connecting flights, all on time, no problem. Legroom okay, although I did find the seats uncomfortable on the longer leg from Turkey to Egypt. Food and drink prices a rip off on the international flight compared to the domestic for exactly the same menu. A bit of a problem on the return flight when upon arrival in Bodrum I discovered that my suitcase had a large crack in it, but resolved in about 20 mins when they gave me a new case! Cheap and cheerful, no delays.",3,"2019",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Turkey's answer to Ryanair :-(","Bokked a trip via KLM.com, from Norway to Ankara, Turkey. Pegasus Airlines operated flight from Amsterdam to Istanbul, and onwards to Ankara. Very disappointed with Pegasus: Little legroom, had to pay for water/coffe etc., interior was in bad shape.
The seats on the flight from Istanbul to Ankara had no reclining possibilities (like Ryanair). I expected more!!",3,"2019",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","its a Turkish budget airline company.","its a Turkish budget airline company, operates from and to most of the European cities, the best thing is the fare, rest all same as many other budget airlines, the bad thing there are no seat adjustment option available, you just sit as you are sitting on a rock chair till end of your journey,. they keep their schedules on-time without delays, and the on board staff are good for selling you their stuff including food drinks etc.. over all its an average airlines for cost saving travelers.",3,"2019",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Good service at the airport","We booked online by Pegasus, and there were no issues. A good price and good offers for your bagage.
We landed in Istanbul and had to catch the next flight to Bodrum. At the AirPort we were helped very well and had a quick pass through. Super.
Next time again",3,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Flight Delay, Delay and Delay..","Flight delay, delay and delay till 5 hours plus 1 hour inside flight.. Flight services are bad.. Passengers are too pissed off and shouted here and there since lost patient inside flight.. Written for compensation due to flight delay.. Their replied just give excuses and probably no compensation.. Worst flight ever..",3,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Ruined luggage, abysmal customer service","My luggage was severely damaged on a Pegasus flight - it was covered in black marks and looked like it had been kicked along the ground. The outside was soaking and some inside belongings were ruined. A totally inadequate and flawed website meant it was impossible to complain and I finally tweeted the company. They’ve been leading me round in circles for the last few weeks, repeatedly asking me to send the same info, giving me the same advice (to use their faulty website) and finally insisting that they had sent me an email which never arrived. They now refuse to resend the email and have started to totally ignore my tweets to them. It is literally the worst service I have ever received on an airline and believe they are being deliberately obstructive so I give up and go away. I would never, ever fly with this airline again and would advise others not to do so either. Appalling.",3,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Trip to Berlin","Took a flight to Berlin from Istanbul Sabiha Gokcen Airport. Flight was good overall and nothing special. Istanbul Sabiha airport is not the best place to fly from as they don't offer free wifi. If wifi is needed you have to get a coupon from a restaurant.",3,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Horrible customer service - very late delivery for luggages","They delivered my luggages with 4 days late! I asked them only to send me a document in which they confirm that they didn’t refund me anything in order to get a refund from my credit card insurance. They refused that!!!
Avoid this airline",3,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","The worst ever","I advise every one don't even think to try even if it's free of charge.
I had a flight with transit 3 hour in turkey.
Becous of the limited awareness the missed me my flight and noway to explane, very very rude way in speaking.
Later they find that there were wrong and give me another tekit after 24 hours should stay in airport.
Same time I met 3 people with same cases a like.....!!!
Pay much a bit and meet a polite..",3,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","trip to istanbul","Great that they fly from Stansted, a bit like Ryanair seats but have a pocket and provide sick bags. The seat are a better colour. Announcement's done in 3 languages .Toilets are clean, they take Euro to pay for things bought on board. Flight was about 15 mins late taking off both ways. No frills",3,"2019",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","EXTREMELY BAD! SUPER UNPROFESSIONAL. PLEASE DO NOT FALL INTO THIS.","This was my first time to Istanbul. Everything was amazing and went smooth except when we decided to leave the country. Our flight was going to depart at 9:05 pm and we managed to be in the airport at 6 pm as we heard there's a lot of traffic. We stayed two hours on the check-in, very disorganized and super slow. Right after we finished we jumped to the gates where there was also so much traffic. On the scan, they decided to open our handbag and search an item after the other. They unwrapped all gifts, threw some things off as they believed it shouldnt go on airplane (Eg. small Jam although it was well wrapped by the shop since we told them we are travelling). It might be the case that this is not allowed but as first time tourists, they could have at least explained in good diplomacy instead of wasting half n hour of our time and throwing everything in one go. When this was done, we ran to the gate as it was within minutes that the flight would depart. The gates closed and there were also 6 other people complaining and yelling to go inside. They did not allow us. And they were yelling most of the time. YOK ENGLISH YOK ARABIC was all I heard. We tried explaining that we were stuck on passport and check in control due to traffic but no body gets it. We were asked to go to Pegasus office where we could catch the second flight at no extra charges since what happened with us was an airport + airlines mismanagement. However, the lady there called FATIMA NIYAL was way too rude and unprofessional. Extremely loud, not willing to communicate and not willing to listen, gave us a lecture of being late and told us to expect anything when traveling. Well, what I expect is 1) Customer Service since I am paying for every single thing done 2) Proper communication, professional attitude and RESPECT 3) Clear rules and guidelines for departures

My advise: DO NOT use this airlines. It is shameful.",3,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Very Bad","I traveled in Pegasus air line from Istanbul to Muscat and I will never use this air line any more. The services was very bad and the cabinet crew attitude was very bad. My child was crying as he need some water when I asked them to provide some
water for him they told me to pay
9TL or 1.5€ or use crdit card, which I don't have at that moment I told them I will pay by Omany currency or deposit card but they refused. Then I found 8.5TL but still they refused to accept it as they asked 9TL, finally after very hot discussion with them becuse my child keep crying as still he need some water we force them to accept the Omany currency or 8.5TL. Also the flight doesn't have any screen. I hate this air line and I will never use it any more",3,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Great cheap flight","best cheap airline i travelled with . Great price , flights on time , checki-in service is good , seats are wide nd comfy .cabin crew are nice and helpfull. Gr8 choice . ............................................",3,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Great flight","My flight was from Berlin to İstanbul Sabiha Airport. Our flight was one of the best flight we had ever. The pilots and hostess were great. I will fly again with Pegasus airlines. I highly recommend Pegasus Airlines to everyone...",3,"2019",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Such a good deal for short flights","I heard so many complaints about this budget airlines by reading reviews, it almost had me scared not to go. My experience was just fine. It was super cheap and there wasn't one thing to complain about for such a short flight. Drink a glass a water before you go and enjoy the savings. Flight was smooth and safe most of all.",3,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst experience ever!! Be careful!!","Made the worst mistake of my life choosing this airline. Booked advantage package from Istanbul to Antalya. Got to know at the airport that our flight is cancelled so were shifted to the next flight after a long hassle. Waited 3 hours for the next flight which was further delayed by 2 more hours. We were denied a pre-ordered meal (paid online) because the cabin crew said they were not “informed” about our meal. Would never fly again with them.

Please don’t book them unless you have no other option!! They have horrible behavior with the customers. If you ask them anything about delays, departures or in-flight meal, they’ll rudely say “I DON’T KNOW”!!!",3,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Not bad","I get nervous on foreign flights but as soon as I entered the plane, the staff made me feel relaxed..",3,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Friendly Crew","Our Flight was very cheap. Pegasus don’t gives any food or drinks. But the prices for sandwiches and drinks all totally ok. The crew was very friendly they helped us where they can. My mother hadn’t eaten something before the flight so she felt very bad and the crew gived her something to eat for free. Thank you guys. I would fly with pegasus again.",3,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Cheap flight","The flight was okay, the customer service was horrible on that flight. The seats are too cramped and it is so uncomfortable for tall people. Meals are at a fee.",3,"2019",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Cheap but great flight!","This flight we had with Pegasus airline was just as good as with any other non-low-cost company. We have enjoyed the flight in most likely new Boeing 737-800.",3,"2019",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Cheap and enough Good","I booked this Flight for extremely cheap money and i think this airline is Good enough to flied with. we had delay which can happen for any airline. the Flight was safe and every thing was fine.",3,"2019",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","I think it is the worst airline in the world","I had right to carry cabin baggage for 8 kg. They stopped me in the ticket control and said to me they should measure it again even it had ladder . and hostes didnt show the measurement and wanted money for extra kilos and there was just one purse and they obligate me to pay this money .It is worst and bad and bad airlines ever I will never buy any flight even if it free . Never ever it is impossible now",3,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Dont fly with pegasus","Worst ever. Checking lines are 300 people. Luggage service's slowest. No english, no manners. No go.",3,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Budget! Budget! Budget!","That's the airline motto, it surprises me how it can offer such low prices yet still offer a decent way transport a person from point A to B. Don't expect much from it as it main purpose is not leisure or comfort, it just a service provider and it sure does the job and quite fast I must add.",3,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Cheap & Safe","If you don't need comfort and just want to arrive safety and cheap, don't think too much. Please remember to choose for short distance flies.",3,"2019",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Terrible!!!!!!!!!!!","They destroyed my luggage, then offered a tiny amount to compensate. After 1 month of emails and negotiations, I still didn't receive any payment. They asked for a receipt of my baggage, and I showed them its price on a known website. They didn't accept to pay the price of the baggage unless I show them a receipt, or pay a specialist (which is going to cost more than the baggage itself) to value the baggage.

Shameful, pity, worst company I've ever dealt with in my entire existence.",3,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worth the price you pay","Would not complaint based on the price. Service is acceptable. Seat is not that comfortable. Overall, it is a choice if you want to save some money to spend elsewhere during your trip.",2,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Rudeness","Unfortunately almost all the employees of the Istanbul airport don't speak English which makes everything difficult. I book my third flight from Pegasus airlines and I did check in at home a day before , payed for a specific seat and when I went to drop luggage, they gave me another random seat. I notice few minutes later so I went back to complaint about it. They were obviously not happy with the fact that they had extra work so the guy took me to the 'supervisor' which was a female and super rude. She gave me another seat 'F' instead of 'A' , and when I said I wanted that specific seat because I paid for it. She was super rude, and took the ticket from my hand almost letting my passport falling to the floor. And start to curse in Turkish.",2,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Flight delay nightmare","Recently flew with Pegasus from Dalaman to Istanbul then due to get a connection to Stansted.
Due to fog we were delayed for over 4 hours!
We were not given any information, the airline did not follow their own guidelines in providing refreshments or hot meal. What we were given was a cheese roll no choice or consideration given to allergies or diet! We were left without being able to contact family who were due to meet us at other end!
My partner went without food and drinks for hours!
We were given incorrect information regarding connecting flight! We were told we had time to eat and drink! We didn’t even have time to pee!
It was only because we checked flight board that we knew we didn’t have a further 3 hour delay but that our flight was in fact boarding and on a final call!
Pegasus customer service needs a review, it also needs to be able to provide clear guidance to ALL its customers so that it doesn’t appear to favour some over others!",2,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worth a try in my experience.","Although a little reluctant to do a connecting flight I thought it was worth a try. Comparing their prices to other low cost air lines the flight taken was less than half the price. I changed at SabibaGokcen, Istanbul other airport. It's easy to find your way around and the staff are very helpful.
Check-in was simple and efficient as was the service all the way through. Comfy seats with reasonable leg room and an inexpensive choice of onboard drinks and eats.
Flights were on time, connection was straightforward and if you take hold luggage this is transferred for you. I'm always wary about this ad I've had suitcases go missing with other airlines. Not with Pegasus. As the flights are through domestic halls the cost of getting snacks is cheaper than international arrival halls...impressed me.
The only downside is the trek to Stansted as I live in the Midlands, but if you can travel there without too much compromise, do the maths and see if you can save some money. It may not always be the case but I've travelled with Pegasus a few times and find it a pleasurable experience",2,"2019",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Long flight affordable prise","It was fine when you compare to the fee for the flight. The plane was modern and comfortable. I advise to everyone to chose this company and destination",2,"2019",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Cheap flight","Flights from London and Istanbul both weren’t on time because of the weather in Istanbul. Tiny legrooms made the flight uncomfortable but the price was nearly half the price of the other airlines.",2,"2019",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Good low cost airline.","One of the best low cost airlines i have travelled, good leg space, polite crew, of course you have to pay for everything in flight, water, food etc and it is not cheap, but that is how it goes with every low cost airline.
Overall it was a decent experience.",2,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Unhelpful!!","I was travelling back home after a visit to the UK. The flight was delayed by 30 minutes and not giving me much time to get my connection from Istanbul back to Bodrum.
I informed the flight attendants who assured myself and another lady who also had a connecting flight that there would be someone there to meet us and fast track us through 2 lots of passport control, how wrong could they be!!! We went to the help desk explained the situation but wasn't even interested in us any help it was now 17.40 and the boarding gates are closed 10 minutes before the flight takes off, we still hadn't seen the first passport control. To cut a king story short I don't recommend this to anyone but we climbed over barriers to get to the front of the queue and bypass everyone even though we annoyed alot of people then did the same at the second passport control we got to our flight just as they were about to close the gate .....
Well done ""Pegasus"" for being unhelpful, not giving your customers any help when they needed it .... and not even listening to their point of view had you let us off the aircraft first then maybe we would never have gone to the lengths we did at climbing over barriers to catch our next flight home",2,"2019",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Low Cost","This is a low cost airline. We paid around 100 Euros for two persons, a real bargain. Staff was helpfull, the aircraft was new. But offcourse leg room was not over average. Anyway, if they keep the prices like this, we will be their customers :)",2,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","average flight for average price!!!","just like ryan air and the other. cheap price, cheap service. We traveled with kids and did not get much help.",2,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Great Airline","Seeing as none of the UK airlines fly to Sharm el Sheikh anymore I found a sight that flew from the UK via Istanbul to Sharm. Yes it took a little longer to get there but well worth it as I love Sharm. I flew in Jan 19 and it only cost me around £240 for 4 flights. Great value for money and it included 20kg of luggage and 4 meals. Can't complain with that. Pegasus Airlines thank you very much for not being over priced, and for getting me to my little place of paradise.",2,"2019",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Best economic flight","Arrived on time, economic flight, frindly personel, flexible ticket opportunity, good food on order,",2,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","moderate price for moderate services","nice flight, comfortable seats with an average price ( below the normal prices), need to purchase more bags if you have more",2,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Good","On time both ways.Food ordered was quite poor but adequate.This is a low cost airline so you basically get what you pay for.The aircraft was new,and the cabin crew were friendly and efficient.Seating was fairly cramped but fine for a four hour trip. Would I use them again and the answer would be yes",2,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Great Airline","I was sceptical about flying with a Turkish airline but I have to say the 2 occasions I have flown with them in the past 2 months, the flights have always been a pleasant experience.
I love the fact that you can watch movies or other entertainment programmes on the wifi on board, this helps pass the time.
Service has always been very good a d would recommend them. Just booked my next flight with them already.",2,"2019",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Absolutely the worst — AVOID","The flight was okay. The online check-in process was completely miserable. Enter all your information, including credit card to pay for baggage. Click pay and the screen disappears. Over end over again, over two days, on four different devices. It just doesn’t work. And if you pay for baggage at the airport they charge you more—because their website doesn’t work.",2,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Very much on time with new planes","An overal pleasant Journey with stop over at the smaller of the Istanbul airports (Golcen?).
All for of our departures and arrivals ahead of time. Check-in very efficient. Of course, the usual night arrivals and departures of most airlines to/from Sharm el Sheik are not pleasant.",2,"2019",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Never again","Not much problem at Stansted airport. But they do weigh the hand baggage to make sure it isn’t over 8 kg . The seats are very uncomfortable and you can feel the knees of the person behind you in your back all the time . Air hostesses rarely smile . In the way back, make sure you leave really early to get to SAW airport. The traffic is horrendous. When you get to the airport, you have to screen all baggage. If you are slow or take time due to helping your kids , people who are behind you in the queue will push their way ahead of you, which I found really rude. We had already done out on line check in but as we had bags to check in, we had to stand in this really long queue which took forever. Then passport control and then security check again! Then my son got stopped for a random search and our friends who traveled with us were stopped before entering the plane to weigh their hand luggage and we had seen several people with huge big bags not being stopped... I wonder why ?",2,"2019",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Uncomfortable seats/ cocky flight attendants","Really disappointed with Pegasus Airlines. I used this airline for the first time and I don't think I would do it anymore. Some of the reasons are: Uncomfortable seats which were not adjustable at all/ cocky flight attendants (mostly girls both ways) they knew nothing about being humble and service minded.",2,"2019",2

Want to vent about what happened...I have online checked in, with a mobile barcode. I arrived at 8:15am when my flight is 10:00am with Pegasus. They said it was not necessary to print it out. When I am finally at passport control window, the custom said I need to print out and told me to go back to check in counter. It is 8:45 at this time. I made a mistake of going to the counter instead of the machine(would have changed everything). They kept on dodging me like a ball, to another side of check in counter, to supervisior (who was too busy to ignore my presence and another staff told me to line up again at another side of check in counter), special case counter. And finally when someone was willing to assist me at the machine, it was 9:15, and too late to use the machine self check in. They asked me to go to the supervisor again. The process goes on. I kept on asking for attention but they just kept on dodging me around. At 9:45, the supervisor said it was too late and it is not their fault. I should have printed it out and told me to buy a new plane ticket....I was not even late at the airport to begin with!

I was usually very patient. I am now furious. Even tourist agency outside speak better english than Pegasus staff and Custom Officer. They only know how to say""Please calm down"" and ""D11 Supervisor"" and didnt understand my request to assist me to the counter because I already tried lining up at D11. Have to say the lady at Ticket Office was super nice and patient though.

Now I am lining up for my newly bought ticket at the boarding gate. It is 30 minutes later than the said boarding time. If someone was willing to help me, would have been able to catch my first flight.",2,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Good deals","i booked with pegasus because at times they have some real good deals. i managed to grab a return flight to Istanbul from Stansted off of their website for only £75.

the plane itself is alright, maybe a little upgrade from Ryan air. I was way too knackered to remember if there was any onboard entertainment, im 90% sure there wasn't any.

No complimentary meal even though the flight is over 4 hours. however staff had smiles and were helpfull.

only complaint was that on the return flight there was no space in the plane for at least a dozen customers hand language, me included.
which resulted in the lanes being blocked and lots of passengers being confused, staff where also a little lost.

however 20 minutes later they decided to put them in the hold. many customers brought really big bags on as hand laguages and it was really annoying as i travel light and only had a 30ltr backpack but now had to wait at baggage claim once i land.

however apart from that i cant complain in regards to how much i paid for the flights.",2,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Always a good option","I have been travelling with Pegasus 7 times in the last 2 years. My destinations were Istambul and Izmir. They have bonus points system which you can get some discounts if you know you'll use it several times, so it is great for me. Always keep in mind that Pegasus is a low-cost airline company, so do not expect luxurious service, extra comfy and spacious seats, delicious meals coming from a Michelin Star restaurant... You can choose another alternative paying more than double for that. They have some restrictions on luggage size and kg. Even they are slightly more permissive than other European low-cost companies, do not overpass them and blame to the company because of overcharging you. You broke the rule! So if you really understand what you are purchasing and you follow the rules, you will have a smooth flight. I only had a problem and it was because of metheorological conditions (we could not land in Istambul SAW) so I missed my interconnected flight to Barcelona. They solved it easily (even the long waiting queue), they changed my flight to the following one and without paying any extra. Efficient staff, smooth flights, barely delays... Great considering it is a low-cost!",2,"2019",5

"Pegasus-Airlines","Great flight","What people find to complain about and the exaggerated way they express themselves is sometimes quite absurd.

No European airline is as bad as some people seem to find the need to say about Pegasus ... and I suspect they complain just because they can.

I have flown on Pegasus a couple of time and on each occasion found them excellent ... every bit as good as Easyjet or Ryanair.

I was struck by the friendliness of the cabin staff on both flights ... the inflight service was exactly the same as the other low cost airlines (yes, you have to pay ... that’s how low cost airlines work!!!) ... the state of the plane was good ... and we left on time on each occasion.

I would have absolutely no hesitation flying with Pegasus again and would recommend the airline wholeheartedly.",2,"2019",5

Never again travelling through turkey on any Turkish airlines.",2,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Terrible airline, staff and service","One of the worst airlines I have ever tried, and I have tried a lot. The problem started already before the flight when they had managed to write my last name twice on the booking. I sent a request which they didn’t answer before after the flight was over 4 days later.. and the answer was them just asking for my pass information. Totally useless. The online check-in didn’t work either and they had failed to register that we had a visa for Oman even though we put that in in the online platform. Luckily the Norwegians in the check-in counter in Oslo fixed it for me.

Then came the flights.. no food or water on long haul flights, no entertainment system at all, the plane looks old and are dirty, and the seats can’t be laid down and are terrible to sit in. There are not even a pocket for you to put your stuff in most flights, probably because they want to squeeze seats even more together as there are extremely little space. The worst thing though, is the service. The people working there have absolutely no interest of having you there or helping you. The flight was almost 1,5 hours delayed, but they did no effort to catch up the time. When we expressed our concern that we might miss our connection they seemed annoyed that we were asking for help. We asked if they could check with the other plane or tell us if the flight were waiting, but they just shook their head and told us they couldn’t help. It’s the same company... we asked again and they said they were going to come back to us, but instead they just walked by and looked in the floor, ignoring us. It is the most unprofessional behavour I have ever experienced in an airline. To top it up the flight staff can’t really speak English..

Furthermore, On some connection flights with THE SAME COMPANY they don’t give you boarding pass for the entire flight. Instead you have to visit a transfer desk in Istanbul which is extremely unefficient and the people there clearly hate their job. They don’t even try to guide you, but instead lash out on customers and other travelers. They made a total mess with the queue, and started screaming at people. On of them actually started threatening people and walked up to a persons face as if he was going to hit him!!

I have never spent my time writing a review like this before, but if I can stop anyone from spending any money on this terrible company, then it will be worth it.. stay away!!",2,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Travelling with Pegasus airlines","Given that pegasus is a low cost company, I did not expected too much from it. However, I was very happy with the price! The plane took off and landed on time as well. Landing was smooth too. The real problem is at SAW airport in istanbul, as it has a poor infrastructure and toilets are very dirty, much like the Beirut international airport! I was upset in the return trip because the flight schedule was changed. I was informed by the change two weeks in advance, but the point is that I booked this flight for a higher price as in departs from SAW at 20:30--the next flight deprts at 21:30; after being rescheduled it departed at 11:15. All in all, I recommend this airline for short flights, not for flights that take more than three hours.",2,"2019",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Just pay the extra 20$ with another company","Worst company ever! Please pay the extra 20$ with another company and do not take pegasus.
I was traveling with pegasus from london to Beirut through a connected flight passing by istanbul.
When i was at the check in desk in london Stansted i have a Baggage 19kg and a hand luggage 11kg and my bag 3kgs. I asked the lady at the desk if this was okey since my parents were still there, so they could have paid for me the extra kilos, and she said it was fine, she sent the big luggage and i took my cabin luggage and left.
When i arrived to istanbul Sabiha Gökçen Airport , and was at the gates and about to enter the plane a women and a man said they wanted to check my luggage weight. They checked and said i have 5 extra kgs and that i cannot enter the plane before i pay 120$. Although i told them that i had A connected flight and that the lady in london said it was okey, they were disrespectful and said it wasn’t their problem. I said this is not right i have no money, they could have charged me at the beginning (when my parents were there) .
I told the guy i have no money, and that i was gonna wear everything i have, he was angry (because he wasn’t able to steal my money and make a commission from me) and start yelling how are you gonna wear everything you cant do that you have to pay!
I just opened my bag and literally wore everything. Just there in the middle of the way in front of everyone.
Instead of just letting me go he was standing there saying the plane gonna leave if you lose your flight it’s your responsibility. At the end,
after wearing 3 pants, 5 dresses 2 hats 2 jackets i was ok to go.
Anyway, this was humiliating, unprofessional and disrespectful. I asked for the guys name so i can fill a complaint but he wouldnt give me his name ! It’s crazy what people would do for money.
If you wanna do your job, just do it right from the start instead of trying to steal from a student Travelling alone.
Worst service ever! I understand he is doing his job and i know it’s a low cost company but we are human, and if you gonna make business with humans you gotta have a little of humanity.
im never travelling with them again and i hope this guy gets humiliated the same way he humiliates people.",2,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Not bad","Well, based to the cheap price the services are fine, smooth and quick check in, helpful staff and cabin crews, maybe the only bad thing they don't serve water, If you will buy some food in flight I advise you to bring change or use credit card.",2,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Friendly cabin crew on Pegasus!","Had a very enjoyable flight to istanbul with Pegasus. Nice friendly cabin crew. I usually get an aisle seat with them.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Bad service Not organized at all","Was not good experience at all with this airline selection

1. i booked through online and they asked for money to allocate the seat which is normal for airlines, make sense. But at the time of boarding i tried to reach early in order to request for the window or aisle seat but what a surprising answer was system allocate the seats auto and we cannot change it. which i never heard from any airline before. and still they were insisting to make us Pay.

2. seats were fixed and the back you cannot even move if you want to rest. its like you need to stay awake if you are traveling with this airline no chance to move the seat back to relax at all

3. there is no place or no announcement which shows how much journey done and how much left just you stay blindly in cabin hoping you will reach you destination

4. flight from Turkey to Dubai. two westerners don't know from which country they bought alcohol from staff on board and got drunk for 2 hours they keep on making jokes in the cabin with their colleagues with high voice.
the flight was in early morning at 1 AM and all cabin passengers were frustrated with that IN-SPITE OF complaining to the cabin crew they did not even stop them for a single time.
Instead of letting them get to their seats they kept selling them more alcohol to make their commission which was the worst situation ever.

staff do not care about other passengers but to up sell only during flight for their commission which given big disappointment",2,"2019",2

They also mentioned clearly that expenditures for me to get from Barcelona to Madrid would be reimbursed (up to a threshold).

I had to book a flight Barcelona-Madrid, but when I requested the reimbursement the online customer service rep said I was not eligible because the delay was caused due to weather. This was totally different from what the airport staff offered.",1,"2019",3

I was forced to sleep at the airport as there was no alternative offered. At 09.00 I went back to the Information Desk to confirm the booking, only to be told, by another employee, that I wasn't booked on any flight and would have to take the 03.25 flight the following morning.
Thankfully I booked with Kiwi.com and they sorted out all my onward flights, and a hotel, after I booked myself on the 12.00 flight.

The staff were extremely unhelpful with the situation and told us to wait at the side while they sort something out. They were in fact doing nothing and stalling us even more! We had seen the bus leave just as we got to the gate but they were apparently unable to help us with anything! We then waited for 3 hours for our bags to be returned to us at Istanbul Airport (funny that the bags could be taken off the plane, but we couldn't be put on the plane!)

Downside of Pegasus is the journey to stansted if you live in Surrey/ hants.",1,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst experience ever (The airline canceled my ticket without any notification)","I'm very disappointed about the service provided by Pegasus.

On 15/12/2018, I bought the ticket from Beirut to Istanbul. Yesterday, I was trying to log into the website to check my flight information and the system didn't work. Then, I called customer service and I found out my ticket was canceled and I had no idea about it. No one from the airline has ever contacted me not even with an email notification.

At first, the representative told me that my bank sent a notice of suspicious transaction and the airline called me once and I didn't answer the call. So the airline decided to cancel my ticket. I called my bank, they told me that they have never call the airline to cancel my ticket. Regardless what actually happened, why don't they send me an email for the cancelation?

I then submitted an application through customer center. I called back and check more than 4 times. The representatives have been giving me false information regarding the process time. At first, the representative told me that I will be contacted on next day. On the next day noon, I called in again, I was on hold for 40+ minutes and then she dropped my call. And then, I called in again, they told me that I will be contacted in next 6 to 9 hours. Then, at night, still no one contacted me. So I called in again, and they told me that he doesn't know when the department will contact me.

During the meantime, the customer representatives have never been proactive to help my situation. I had to come up with my own idea of making a new reservation and requesting the representative to freeze my reservation price because I need to take the flight in few days and the flight price has been increased a lot.

Anyway, I decided to pay the new reservation first because the price has been increased a lot. On the last call, I have to ask the customer representative to send an email to his manager to ask you guys don't cancel my new ticket without any notification.

Anyway, this is my experience with the airline so far. REALLY BAD.",1,"2019",1

Baggage policies, if you did not select to check baggage online in advance there are a lot of hidden fees. The airline employee’s must be getting a kick-back on these fee’s because employee # 420498 made and admitted a mistake on her part of 8kg excess baggage but would not reimburse the extra charge.

"Pegasus-Airlines","USP: Delayed flights","Travelled from Antalya to Istanbul on December 30, 2018 and back same day. The flight was delayed on both occasions. Morning flight of 8:30 am departed at 10:30 am and evening flight of 23:30 pm departed an hour later.

A day's visit to Istanbul from Antalya was badly spoilt due to the delayed flight.

Even in the flight there were continuous announcements which made it irritating.

Travelled first and last time in it. It was selected by travel guide probably due to its low cost. I would dissuade people from taking it.",1,"2019",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Everything went smooth.","The only problem is that there is no tram/metro from SAW airport. There are however buses which are cheap and not much different from private vans, as those vans have to stand in traffic.
The flight itself was fine. no delay.",1,"2019",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Stay away from this airline","Stupid staff, not helpful and rude! Not recommended. I missed my flight because of the idiotic staff. Pay more and fly with Turkish airways! anyways wouldn’t book it again even if they were giving free flights.",12,"2018",1

"Pegasus-Airlines","Beware Flexi-tickets are not fully flexi!!!","I recently brought a ticket on this airline, purchasing a business flexi-flight since I had a lot of luggage and wanted the flexibility to change the flight. When I decided I needed to change the ticket I tried to but it reverts back to the basic package - in otherwords no luggage and no flexibility. This was not stated clearly (I didn’t see any mention of it) when I booked and was only shown when tried to change. I called up and they stated this was the policy. Very unimpressed!",12,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Really Bad Budget Airline ""NOT RECOMMENDED""","We were unfortunate to use this unknown airline as the business didn't have anymore funds to buy a normal ticket out, so they settled for the cheapest and believe me they are the cheapest for a reason.

CHECKIN

Online checking wasn't available on our flight as it was the cheap of the cheap so we had to check in at the counter, however they sent me an email the day before saying we could check in “at the counter”!!

Checking in was easy as we got rid of most of our things as we only had 20kg each and 8kg carry on, our baggage was 35kg so you can image trying to get rid of lots of stuff you have accumulated over a period in another country. Excess baggage wasn't an option as it was 90 euros for 5 kg, the company wasn't going to pay excess baggage for us. So we were checked in for both flights, from Muscat to Istanbul, then Istanbul to Muscat with a 2 hour connection in between.

BOARDING

We went to the gate and waited, waited and waited like everyone else for something to happen as the flight was delayed but there was no one around the ask what wa happening, typical hide your head in the sand and nothing can happen!! An hour after we are informed the plane would be boarding, 4 or 5 times but still no movement and we were worried about our connecting flight. Finally we spoke to something and they were completely chilled about everything stating we will be boarding soon and not to worry about the connecting flight!!

IN FLIGHT

In flight service was really sad, the airlines staff were obviously not happy with the work they were doing and it was noticeable, only getting off their seats to deal with issues. We asked a few times for water but were ignored then suddenly someone grudgingly brought us water. Seats were horrible, no tv, no frills flight, with very limited selection, luckily we thought the company had ordered us a meal but it was the cheapest option a rock hard chicken sandwich (we don't eat meat), Meals were 13 to 15 euros for a bit of nothing so we skipped to wait in Istanbul.

ISTANBUL

We arrived into Istanbul and were taxied off to another part of the airport and waited for buses, then we had a time consuming sightsee around the airport before arriving at the International terminal.

We had 1 hour to catch our flight and we didn't know where to go or how far the boarding was as no one was assisting. We entered the terminal and were shocked at the stampede of people rushing towards the transfers desk and international transfers section.

We asked one of the airline reps and were told to get in queue like everyone else. You can only imagine the amount of people in the same situation and the queue wasn't going down anytime soon as we had to go through airport security again, complete nonsense but life.

We made a decision to skip the queue and go in front something we hated doing as it wasnt fair on anyone else but if we didn't we would have missed our flight as no one else cared about prioritising people for their flights. Just utter Chaos.

BOARDING ISTANBUL TO MADRID

We finally made it to the gate and as usual it was deleted but thankfully for us as we wouldn't have made the connecting flight and we don't want to even think about going to the customer service desk which had over 100 people waiting. As usual no one knew what was happening then suddenly again a single check in assistant from Pegasus started boarding people with no announcement or anything, very funny. Which caused another stampede of people rushing to the gate. So we were processed and headed down the gantry to the aircraft only to find another queue of people waiting to board the aircraft which was another 15 minutes.

FLIGHT TIME

We were in shock at sitting down and realising the seats don't recline, with no neck support or cushions or blankets it was going to be a really interesting flight. In the air the stewards brought us another sandwich luckily it was a cheese sandwich, a very hard sandwich you couldn't bite but soak up in a cup of coffee.

ARRIVAL IN MADRID

We arrived in Madrid absolutely exhausted from a lack of sleep, due to very uncomfortable seats and a lack of fluids. We taxied to the terminal 1, which if you don't know is very painful as you get to sight see most of Barajas airport. Collecting baggage was easy and the best thing about the flight was leaving the airport.

The best part was as soon as we landed about 75% of the passengers stood up to collect their bags, the airline staff told them to sit down but no one was listening, even the captain informed all passengers to sit down but again it fell on deaf ears.

RECOMMENDATION

DO NOT DO IT, unless you have no money, you want to experiment and try a budget long haul flight and don't have any feelings.

We have now been in Madrid for 5 days and we still have back pain due to the seats, something I have never experienced before only on Military C130s.

I can't complain much since I found one of the best prices for our trip, however, I wouldn't choose this airline for any flight longer than 5 hours.

Leg room was bit cramped and seat had an average comfort. Aircraft looked and felt old. My seat refused to recline on inbound flight. We didn't didn't order the food so not sure about the quality.

For some odd reason, the check in process in Abu Dhabi and Istanbul was quite slow compare to other airlines we have traveled before.",12,"2018",3

The ground crew was unable to control 8 50 passengers. They handled the situation really badly. Cops need to come to our gate and take control
On my flight back from Copenhagen to Istanbul, I was a sleep but I woke up when they were serving the food. I had already pre-ordered my food when I was purchasing the ticket. They did not see me wake up. I buzzed the flight attendants 6 or 7 times and they never responded back. When they started selling duty free items I asked them if I had done anything wrong and why they have not served me what I had ordered even if I was a sleep. You pay and you do not get what you asked for. They will keep it to themselves? The flight attendant said that because I was a sleep. Then why didn't they if I woke up, why didn't they respond to my 7 times buzzing. No excuse. I am really upset. The company is not worth any money I spent",12,"2018",1

The plane I traveled in was an Airbus A330-300 and was comfortable enough for the short trip I took (3h40m total time per flight). I wouldn’t recommend it for long flights though, as there is no TV and if you have a hard time sleeping on planes the flight will seem endless. I would definitely travel with them again",12,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","flight attendants are very rude and ill trained","pegasus attraction is online booking and choosing your own way to travel, it is cheap but you can add what you like in food and services on the plane.
The problem is what they deliver which is disappointing. They might change the seat you paid extra for, they might change the rules on you one time they said that the handicap should sit in an aisle seat while the law say they should sit neat the window. As a handicapped person I usually inform them ahead of my status and they are aware of my situation all along the line, Yet flight attendant and ground personal behave so rude and do not accept any mistake created by them on my last trip I was left on the plane for over 40 minutes after all passengers disembarked and the cleaning personal finished cleaning the plain and when the handicapped personal came to help me disembark they said they were alerted by my situation just minutes before.

After few days we tried again and booked the seats for £65 each way (£130 in total). When we arrived at check in we were told that they changed the aircraft and cannot offer me my selected and paid for seats.

On return from holiday we requested a refund without success. They kept sending same email that they investigate and tried to convince me to call their Customer Service abroad.

Doing this I can usually avoid paying extra for hold baggage. In Turkey and some other places you can use your mobile phone to check in. If you're a frequent flyer their points quickly mount up.

It had to fly one hour forty five minutes then land back to Istanbul. The passengers were transferred to another plane. It arrived in Amsterdam with a four hours delay. My connection flight was missed. Pegasus personnel informed in Istanbul that their ground staff in Amsterdam would take care of us and arrange a hotel for that night as the earliest flight was on the next day. When we arrived in Amsterdam there was no Pegasus staff at all. Passengers like myself did not know what to do. Thanks to KLM services we were given hotel vouchers. But my hotel was no show for one night for which I had paid $87. I claimed from Pegasus for that loss but crudely replied that they are not responsible for this loss. There is no need to say that Pegasus is a very low profile budget airline with no free drinks or meals and with very uncomfortable seats with extremely narrow legroom. These are expected and accepted. But such an irresponsible behavior cannot be accepted by an airline. Once again they have proved that they are not a reliable airline.

First of all if what he said corrrect WHY the policeman he need to report me for him???? Dose the policeman in the airport need to report someone who dose any issues for the hotel booking desk!!!??? Or he need to take an direct action?? Or anyone who work at the airport have the right to accuse passengers for no reason???

"Pegasus-Airlines","Well-managed technical delay","My flight FRU-SAW was early in the morning. There was severe fog at the airport. The airport authority and the Company (Pegasus) took the right decision and delayed the flight, indeed the visibility was 50 metres or less. We took off with 75 minutes delay, however I have nothing to criticise, it was totally technical. I was worried before landing because my domestic flight was only 75 minutes after landing and I had little chance to catch the following domestic flight. pegasus made a good surprise at the landing. Three employees met us immediately with our new boarding passes for the next flight. Everything was ready. Yes I could not catch my booked domestic flight due to delay however the Company managed the case very good. Flight was smooth and safe, cabin was almost full. I accept one general criticise, a small cup of water (may be 125 ml) should be given free of charge. Otherwise, food and drink may be paid on board of budget airlines, we all accept this. Always be careful with your hand baggage as the limit is 8 kg. In case of excess, it is recommended to pay extra for check-in luggage.",12,"2018",4

Service is standard - check in to the plane not organized.
Seats are uncomfortable and you can't push them back either - no legspace at all. For the seats at the exit you have to pay extra most of the times.
You have to pay for every thing extra on the plane - even for a pillow.

Also, I weighted my baggages on the check in and they let me pass with additional kgs but their staffs were waiting me on the door of the plane to weight again my baggages and of course to let pay more money.

Landing in Dammam was not easy and we were in aircraft for about 3 hrs with no info what is happening until an announcement in Arabic from some Dammam airport officer was made that GCC National can get down and for rest we don’t know. Airlines staff was barely to be seen and was as ignorant as we were. When all this happened we were told at 6:18 am that we will be flying to Sabiha Istanbul back. By this time airport in kuwait was clear. Turkish airways and several others have landed already. We couldn’t communicate with the staff and were flown to Istanbul were on arrival we were told that our luggage was offloaded in Dammam and we will have to stay two days until they can flybys back. They told they don’t have flight next morning while I was able to book one online. Getting into Turkey was not easy for those who didn’t had an EU passport or schengen visa. We have to pay for our visa stayed there for two days before coming back to kuwait. Had a workshop to give missed a day and received an email in reply to my complaint that am not entitled for any compensation as we were flying neither from or into EU. The baggage arrived 7 days later for all of us and unfortunately mine was crushed. Complaint made battle is on.",12,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Not Good","Worst flight experience ever.
Don't go With the cheap ones.Airlines ground staff is rude and not at all helpful",12,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Pegasus Airlines - You her What you pay for","Seats are tiny, I’m 5 foot tall and I didn’t have enough space to move my legs. The opening table was dirty. They charge coffee 1 euro on domestic flights but 3 euros when flying international. The coffee is the same brand and same amount so why change the price just because your flying to a different country? The flights are cheaper then most airlines. I guess you get what you pay for.",12,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Budget airline","Pegasus is a no frills airline that offers extras if you want to pay more.
The main bonus is the airfare includes 23kg of luggage.
While doing short flights with big bags they are very well worth using.",12,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Average good","Against a number of not-so-good reviews, I decided to fly with Pegasus and spend the weekend in Istanbul. Modern aircrafts, efficient crew, departure and arrival on time both ways, and the price was reasonable. No complains, average good. The only con is that the seats do not recline, but then again, for a one hour flight it was ok.",12,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Very Good Experience","Very good airline for cheap flights. Offers great connecting options towards Europe, especially for a traveler from Lebanon, where we don't have direct flights to several locations. The options to customize your flight experience in terms of baggage, seat selection, and meals allows the traveler to accommodate for needs and just pay accordingly.",12,"2018",4

I've just booked with pegasus for the first time as the prices were so cheap.
The website didn't ask for my passport details. Is this normal???

"Pegasus-Airlines","Not convenient for a business travel","Despite not having any treats other than buying them, the services are satisfactory and staff is genial mostly.
But still, it would not be my first choice for a business travel and for a flight takes more than 2 hours...",11,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Ordinary As Expected Service","Don't know how the seats ended up being more uncomfortable than easy jet :-). Check was as expected and smooth, staff were friendly and helpful. In flight sales and service was good. One leg of the flight was very bumpy but I guess out of their control. Another leg went perfectly smooth. Good value",11,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Typical low budget airline","Very little space. Can't even adjust the seats. Its ok for short trips, but not for long distance. There is only one Plus + its a little bit cheaper than other airlines",11,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Nothing special....typical airline","it were 2 flight with an stop in istanbul. Both flights were similar. Nothing special....a cheap airline! The plane on the 2. flight was a little bit dirty and stinky.",11,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Airline of last resort","No bord service, little space, staff not particularly keen on dealing with unruly passengers. After flying four legs with Pegasus I have to say, I am not particularly looking forward to be flying with them again.",11,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Late and cramped","This is not so much a review of the airline as the experience. It sucked even when the staff were kind. The gate at Schönefeld was a disgrace. We were herded like sheep then trapped when the flight was late. The small 300mL water bottles were 12 lira. Shocking. The arrival at Antalya was smooth but two hours late and so I missed my bus home and had to pay for a hotel.",11,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Good prices, terrible legroom","Pegasus airlines have really low fares for the routes that they operate. Flight was on time.
Seat cushioning was ok but the legroom was terrible! I am just 181 cms tall (5' 11) and I couldn't sit without manspreading. I couldn't keep my legs together even if I tried. There was no space.
There is no In Flight Entertainment system, but that is understandable for a low cost carrier.",11,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Average but good prices!","It is an average airline but with acceptable prices. You should pay more for more than 8 kg suitcases and foods.",11,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Just an ordinary flight","There is a bunch of airlines that call themselves low cost. I am not sure if it is only to try to justify lack of basic services, like sandwiches and water. Pegasus is one of them. Therefore, you get as much as you expect, so nothing special about this airline.",11,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Bad sandwich and expensive payment","I have bought a sandwich and it was not fresh. I wanted to change it and they asked me to pay for new sandwicht too. I have refer te pay with my creditcard but bad choise, it coast 5€ they get 10€ from my card.
So do not buy any sandwiches! And do not pay with card !",11,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","You get what you pay for.","Pegasus is a budget airline from Turkey, so sensible travelers will not be expecting anything special, nor will they get it. On the other hand, the service provided is at least as good as Easyjet, and probably better than Ryanair. I found the staff extremely friendly and helpful, both on the ground and in the air. Basically, considering how much cheaper they were than their nearest rivals, I would say that they deliver.",11,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Low cost, good value","Pegasus flys lots of routes domestically and some international routes including London Paris and Barcelona. We were flying back to LA and transferred in Oslo to Norwegian. Pegasus seat and knee room comparable to major airline economy class. SAW airport, the hub of Pegasus in Istanbul,is on the Asian side and farther from the city center. Also the check-in process took longer, on our Saturday morning flight. So allow more time. Beware that water and food onboard are charged so come prepared. The stated free carried luggage weights pretty restrictive, but nobody weighed anything. Our flight was on time, cabin clean, crew polite.
Overall I consider good value for money and will definitely fly them again.",11,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Great Affordable Airline","I flew Pegasus for the first time to Switzerland and i was i impressed even though is a budget airline . They have good service overall

few things i believe it can make a difference they should install some Screen for movie and make it chargeable as for a trip that it is more than 4 hour it is needed and for their credit card statement they should have the machine that take all kind of credit card as we are multinational people travelling but over all it is a good airline

thanks

"Pegasus-Airlines","Pilot was excellent. Best landing ever! Everyone applauded at landing. Smooth as glass. Not one bump while landing.","First time flying Pegasus. This first leg of our trip was excellent. (We were going on to Dubai after layover in Instanbul) I don't think we experienced one bit of turbulence. The food was surprisingly good. This food and landing experience is the best I can remember while on board an airplane. I will remember the two best positive aspects of this flight for a long time.

B002 » seems a bit light. Especially that there was no one of Pegasus at the airport to help passengers with rebooking or rerouting. We spend over €100 calling a Turkish call center from Belgium, we were hung-up 7 times, promised several call backs by their manager Yurbal who failed to do so... While the only thing we were requesting was that we would get booked on the earliest next available flight on Turkish Airlines, as per the EU-passenger right régulation... The passenger rights information leaflet provided did omit to specify statutory compensation that passenger are entitled to.... etc etc.
Hours later my pregnant wife and I were ushered into busses to a nearby hotel. No dinner or refreshments were provided as promised... no information was provided on how to get back to the airport... or which flight we would be rebooked from...
Pegasus flatly refused to book us on the next available available flight, which was a Turkish Airline flight... instead they ended-up booking us on a flight some 7hours later than the Turkish airline flight and some 24h later than the booked flight. We’re are still waiting for Pegasus to inform us on how to claim back all the additional costs... for missed hotel nights, airport transfer, additional parking, dinner, refreshments etc etc... most of these were prepaid...
Apart from not complying with the law; they even did not have the decency to apologise for the inconvenience... instead they chose to treat us like criminals for requesting what we are due and paid for.",11,"2018",1

"Pegasus-Airlines","Budget Airline Improved to Quality","I was invited to a congress to Cyprus and organisers sent me a Pegasus Airline ticket. The best part was they departed and arrived on time.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Recent flight from Dubai to Antalya using Pegasus, last time I will ever do that, flights from hell","We have a place near Antalya Turkey, it is not easy to get to as there are no direct flights. We have to go via Istanbul whichever airline we choose. We chose Pegasus as they were cheap "" big mistake"" The flight out leaves Dubai at 0330 and is about 4.5 hrs. The flight was rammed and we could only get a window and middle seat. The man who set next to my wife was huge and took up half her seat the seat spacing is so short that as I am 6ft plus I could not get comfortable at all so both we did not get any sleep on the way out. Coming back check in at Antalya with Pegasus is always a nightmare due to their really slow computer system. Again on the way back from Istanbul to Dubai the flight was rammed and the seats really close together, the man next to my wife was once again really big and had a disgusting smell, not the airlines fault but the seat size meant she should could not get any distance from him. The whole experience was just awful, the planes are just not suitable for night flights or long flights and the seats are so uncomfortable. Next time I will pay more and go on a decent airline.",11,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Was a bit scared","I choose this airline as it was the cheapest but still was very expensive because it was school holidays.
Onboard I was a bit scared as it was so old. There were lots of broken bits on the seats and holes on armrests which made me worried.
Not much legroom we were very squashed in.
Unfortunately it was a very bumpy flight which didn’t help with the state of the plane. One of our seats didn’t even have a tray for drink and food because it had broken off.
The plane we was on needed a lot of maintenance or even getting rid of.
Don’t think I will fly with them again.",11,"2018",3

The check before the gate was confused, people stand up in the corridor, drunk people wanted to invade the aerea... everything delayed the flight... The boarding was remote and more time waiting to board byside the airplane. I never saw something more confused in all my life... worst than the poorest bus station in Brazil. Inside the airplane there was no place for all the carry on luggage... more time spent and more time delayed... definitely was a bad experience....",11,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","The worst airline ever for traveling with family!","We just came from Turkey with our 2 year old boy and our 3 months old baby. They gave 1hour an a half of transit time in Istambul, which was a chaos, because in the airport one needs to go through security twice, and the lines of pass control were super slow... we almost miss the connection, because of that. Unfortunately it was booked through an agency, that sells the whole package of hotel all inclusive and one can’t select the airline, anyway, it was a pretty bad service... first at Antalya airport they managed different information regarding baby strollers... we bought yoyo babyzen, which is a stroller designed to take as a hand luggage, most of the airlines aprove it...but not this one. In the counter they said that it was ok to bring it, but not in the airplane, they were very angry with us... we sit our small baby in a car chair that is connected to the stroller, and they took it in the checked luggage, and when we pick it up in the airport it was completely broken. They did not care and not respond for that. As well...in the airplane, the flight attender didn’t offer me the belt for my baby not the lifejacket for my infant, which is illegal. Food was super expensive ( 8euro for 2 small water bottle and a little apple juice)... and the flight attendant’s attitude towards old people was pretty humiliating, as if they were less people because they were slow. This has been the most unaccepted flight experience that I have had. If you are travelling to or from Turkey i suggest not to choose this airline...for you and your family welfare choose another airline if it’s possible.",11,"2018",1

What can i do in airport for 7 hours in the night in this cold weather, also u can just have 20kg loggage . As usual my loggage is 23kg. They charge me for extra in both way. I mean one charge for kharkov to istanbul . And one for istanbul to kharkov. I never see this kind of tricky charge. I just have connection flight why i should pay 2 times for extra loggage. Never ever travel with this unorganized and tricky flight.",11,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Uygun fiyatlı uçuşlar için","To my experience Pegasus Airlines are economic and much better than the other international budget airlines. The seatings were moderately new and clean, the seat gaps were adequate. The meal prices are not very high, especially if compared with the airport prices. Yes you have to pay for the luggage and check-in -if you have a preference- but you still fly for a reasonable price from or to Turkey.",11,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Flying with cats","SAW very busy airport so start early!!! Went through police and customs with minimal fuss, Turkish people love cats and there was a lot of ""ahh and nice"" by the staff. We do this once every year and never had any problem. We brought the cats with us from Hong Kong originally so they are quite use to flying and very well behaved. The airline staff are gorgeous and very helpful. We sit with the cats in the very front seats so other travellers are not bothered by the presence of the cats. We take a friend with us to carry the third cat --one cat by customer rule--. Much appreciated, Pegasus airline!!!!",11,"2018",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Ok for the value paid","Most of the staff weren't very friendly. Check-in and baggage claim were ok. The seats were okay for short flights but not very comfortable on longer flights.

I did love that there was no entertainment onboard. I read a whole book. Also, I loved their sandwich. The instant Turkish coffee though was a bit heavy.",11,"2018",3

"Pegasus-Airlines","Too poor to care","I had never flown with low cost Air Companies ,mostly guarding my comfort and physical health .However I have always understood students and workers ,who happen to use those companies to meet their budged .
And it works for half of the population on Earth .
But if you have been unfortunate to suffer from any kind of travel sickness or medical condition ,I highly recommend you to avoid those companies .The aircrafts are rough ,you feel any vibration and bumping ,there’s no space for your head ,no rest chair ,no foot-space ,no assistance ,no nothing .For domestic flight it may work ,but in longer distances is truly uncomfortable .

"Pegasus-Airlines","Bland Service","They are a Low Cost Carrier and therefore the goal is to get from Point A to B. The service was okay, but do not buy the food they're offering on board.

The agent`s response was ""Yes , we know that !!!!!"" I mentioned to him that the website needs to be updated and more user friendly and his response was "" I just work here , what do you want me to do "". I literally hung up the phone as i knew i would not get any help from him.",11,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","The best price Domestic line","They fly with the best price on domestic linea.Time table works generally on time .Breakfast ,salads and sandwiches are sold by cash or credit card.The crew are friendly",11,"2018",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Want to be ignored- fly Pegasus!!!","There no way to reach the company!!! No hot line working, constant website error, no answer for 2 complaints that had been raised.

"Pegasus-Airlines","The most uncomfortable seats on a par with Ryanair","I had to fly last minute, and so sadly Pegasus wasn't even that cheap (just much cheaper than the competitors). Pegasus have the most uncomfortable seats i've flown with, on a par with Ryanair. They didn't even offer free water, and i flew for two long(ish) flights with them. Horrible",10,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","It is okay to fly Pegasus","I believe people treat Pegasus unfairly. They it is cheap but there is nothing else. It is not true. I flew Pegasus 10+ times, in Turkey and internationally. Some were not perfect but most were better than okay. This is a low cost airline. Do not expect BA service but if you follow the rules (no excess luggage, online check-in, being in time at the airport), life is good with Pegasus.

Eventually, for delayed flights, this is nothing to do with Pegasus, it is the airport. Pegasus doesnt own the airport (SAW) . All airlines are delayed in SAW, especially afternoon flights. Get used to this.",10,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Never again!","I will never use this company again. They charge you double for baggage on connecting flights. The light was delayed for 1 hour. ALL staff spoke no English at ALL.",10,"2018",1

Both flights were delayed more than 1 hour . By chance I had 4 hours wait in Istanbul so it was no problem

If same price with others I would not recommend this airline.",10,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Cheap flight rude staff","The flight was cheap, it arrived on time. The crew was rude and referred to all of us in Turkish, when requested to switch to English, it was obvious why they avoid talking in English - the pronunciation was so bad we ended up guessing from the context what are they trying to say. There was a terrible turbulence on the flight and one of the passengers started vomiting, when we requested for the crew member for help no one arrived. I understand that they may not be allowed to walk during turbulence, but even after it was over no one shown up to check on the passenger.",10,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Boiling hot","Flight was so hot. Luckily I was in a vest top but my partner had a jumper on so she was not so lucky. We did have a meal on the plane which was really nice. Hot and tasty. We had steak which melted in your mouth. So would recommend the food.",10,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Invited","I've ordered tickets with luggage and when i checked in on my way back to Israel the representative of pegasus in the airport said that it was included only on my way to turkey and not in the other direction.it was really suprising and not kind as i needed to carry my luggage to the plane.Also, on my way back to israel i checked in online and it took me something like 1 hour if not more, as the website was avaliable only in turkish????",10,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Cheap and Efficient Flight","Whilst holidaying in Lebanon, we decided to take advantage of the low cost flights and head to Istanbul for a few days of sightseeing and shopping. Our flights with Pegasus were cheap but we were impressed with their efficiency. Flights both ways were on an A370 airbus and we're on time. We had no delays checking in and the staff were friendly and helpful. Be warned that on flight snacks and drinks are not included in the price and that there is no on board entertainment so remember to take a book! I would definitely use Pegasus in future for short flights from Lebanon to neighbouring destinations.",10,"2018",4

Could do with earlier out bound flight.",10,"2018",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Great no-frills experience on both flights","Punctual, polite staff at airport and in air. The aircraft was clean and, for a no-frills airline, surprising not too cramped. Overhead storage was more than adequate for a full flight.",10,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Good for the price","Pleasant trip, times were kept, no delays or baggage problems. Not a lot of leg room but other than that, everything good for the price.",10,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Race to the bottom","The race to the bottom is well underway with this airline.
Chaotic boarding process at Dalaman got us off to a bad start.
There should be minimum seat pitches in international law of at least 35 inches. The result of no law is airlines squash more and more of us in until it becomes so uncomfortable we stop flying.
4hrs is such cramped conditions is almost unbearable.
The crew were amazingly friendly, not their fault.
My future holidays will avoid airlines such as this.",10,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Think budget airline - don't expect anything!","This airline is similar to other budget airlines, you have to buy everything! Keep dollars with you as their card machine does not work and they do not take pound or euros!

The seats are dirty and the plane is not cleaned between flights. There is NO leg room so I would recommend buying 'premium' seats!

The flight itself was smooth for landing and takeoff - so no complains there!",10,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","don't expect much and you'll be fine","Pegasus flies to a considerable number of cities within and outside of Turkey, and while it exists in the shadow of much larger Turkish Airlines it has quite competitive fares --- mostly due to its presence at Istanbul's second airport conveniently known as SAW. I hadn't flown to SAW before, but for this trip the fare was great and my ultimate initial destination was closer to SAW than IST.

Although Pegasus has a number of brand-new aircraft -- in fact a day prior my same flight featured a brand-new A320 -- I flew on an ancient and not-exactly-clean 737. For a flight that departed at 0430 when I was barely awake it really didn't matter. My flight was full except the second row and I managed to move from row four to this empty row and lie down ... call it poor man's business class! Service is what you'd expect from a discount airline: you pay for everything on board, including beverages.",10,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Not my cup of tea","All in all it was acceptable but the trip was unpleasant due to excessive turbulence and the pilot didn’t give a tinkers. Flight attendant fell as she was walking down the isle as we descended to land which made me and a the rest of the passengers panic. Other than that it’s quite a cost effective option to get to Ankara ... but my life is worth more than that ... so never again",10,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","No communication for a 2 hour delay","First flight of the morning 5.20am departure. Luggage check in delayed with no communication leaving everyone standing in a queue. Eventually through security and onto the gate. At 5.05 still no boarding, 5.20 passed and no communication, at 5.50 the boards stated delay of 15 mins, this carried on until 7.20am when the gate opened for boarding with no communication at all. This escalated in missing a connecting flight. End of holiday stress and very tired. Very poor service. Only good point was that the airport had most areas translated into English and German. Aircraft had not been cleaned well as there were broken crisps and sweets on the floor. Usual aircraft crush to put baggage into overhead luggage as no policing on case size ( this is common with most aircraft now in my experience) . Yes the tickets were cheaper to purchase, but the hassle of a transfer means that I would definitely consider a direct flight next time. ( if you thrive with finding best value, we saved £80 each by splitting the flight rather than direct)",10,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Very good company","I love this company, it’s a very good low cost comparing to many others ( much better than easyJet) . Comfortable seats, affordable price.",10,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Musical Chairs!","Musical chairs always seem to be the common theme on any Turkish flight regardless of airline and not just confined to Pegasus. Passengers not sitting in their allocated seats and wanting to sit next to their family or friends cause the usual pre takeoff chaos inside the cabin. This charade of changing seats even continues whilst the aircraft is pushing back on the tarmac. Why people don’t have the foresight to book seats in advance for a small fee or check in early to get a desired seat allocation I don’t know. Now to other matters - Seat comfort and legroom is just about adequate considering you probably won’t be flying for more than a 3-4 hour stretch, perhaps not so if you are unfortunate to get a middle seat in between two big guys. Cabin service is okay the staff do their best to tolerate you, drinks, sandwiches and hot meals are provided on board at cost. The hot meal I had was good and came with a drink for 12 euros. Sandwiches are about 5 euros upwards. If you have pre ordered a meal or sandwich this is normally served soon after takeoff in advance of the normal trolley service. No inflight entertainment on board as is expected with any budget carrier, both my flights were punctual. The carrier provides a generous free 20kg baggage allowance as well as allowing two cabin bags per person. All in all a normal uneventful flight apart from the obligatory pavlova of the seat swapping at the start. For a bit of fun be prepared to clap the captain when the aircraft lands, this is an old Turkish tradition to show your appreciation to the crew for a safe flight! In summary Yes I would travel with them again.",10,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Basic","Nothing to write home about, it’s a basic airline, so noisy, and the staff were not great, they were loud also.
But would use them again.",10,"2018",3

"Pegasus-Airlines","8 HOUR DELAY","So on the 22nd october 2018 (yesterday) we were travelling to istanbul from stanstead airport.The flight was originally at 2pm however due to technical difficulties e.g. fuel leakage it was delayed further and all passengers were unaware of the situation. As a result of the lack of communication skills we had to travel to various gates back and forth on different buses provided by stanstead which was very sickening and eventually we were taken back to the main terminal, to departures due to the aircraft having problems. Along the way the airport staff provided a £10 voucher for refreshments which meant nothing as we just wanted to go to our destination. We waited at the airport for approximately 5 hours until we were transferred over to the delta desks which caused commotion between the staff and the passengers as we were very agitated. Many passengers were shouting as they missed their connecting flights.All the stanstead staff could do was hand out refund forms and accomdate the passengers as the unhelpful pegasus staff were not present at the time. We travelled ovee to the hilton were had to stay in for a night as there were no flights available.The next morning flight was scheduled for 5am but was then changed to 8am so we traveled to the airport which was around 10 minutes away from stanstead airport thinking our flight was to take off at 8am.Arriving they gave us new boarding passes and the flight had a new number however the board in the airport was not updated and the new flight time changed to 11am. No stanstead staff are aware of the situation and we are know stuck at the airport it is currently around 10:15am and no news of what time the flight is.The pegasus representatives were not present.We are very furious as we have paid alot of money for our hotel and flight and have applied for compensation.This is all thanks to the airlines lack of organisation.The companies member of staff were very useless and left everything up to the stanstead airport staff due to poor communication skills. Many passengers were furious and irritated many who were travelling had connected flights which were also missed and werent dealt with. Children and elderly were struggling to put up with the amount of walk we had to do from terminal to terminal. I am currently waiting at the airport (23rd October 2018) and they have not yet given us information about the flight ,they are just handing us £10 refreshment vouchers eventhough all we want is to arrive at our destination. I highly do not request this airline to anyone I wouldn’t even rate it 1 star if i could. DO NOT TRAVEL WITH THEM!",10,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Big disappointment","My wife & I went to a business conference & were taking several members of our office with us. We thought we would try a 'no frills' airline to keep the cost down. Booking the flight was easy & the check-in staff both in Tel Aviv & Amsterdam were friendly & accommodating. That's the end of the good news. There was no order in boarding the plane; a free for all, creating havoc with the overhead luggage bins. The plane itself was cramped & hot (uncomfortably so). As a no frills airline, there is no video entertainment, no audio entertainment and the cabin staff were definitely not entertaining, nor were they friendly or accommodating. We understood there would be no food included with our airfare and brought our own. No problem there, but.......water. Since airport security prohibits taking any liquids in, we were at the mercy of the airline, and.....you guessed it, they wanted EUR 1.50 for a very small bottle of water. I found this practice both extreme & despicable. In a hot, cramped environment, everyone will be thirsty sooner or later, and the airline should provide water to their passengers, even if they want to charge for other drinks. I can't imagine that adding water to their included 'service' would cause more than a minimal increase in airfares, and I think most passengers would be fine with that. The cabin crew spoke almost no English; only Turkish, making communication difficult at best. And they seemed more concerned with making sure seats & tables were in the locked upright position for takeoff & landing than in the comfort of their passengers. Bottom line-we'll never fly with Pegasus again. It was not a pleasant experience.",10,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Ok flight","Check in and boarding went ok but departure was nearly an hour late. Flight crew did a reasonable job and we arrived safely.",10,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Avoid Pegasus Airline at any cost!","We flew Pegasus Airline from Amman to Istanbul via Antalya. This fight was our second experience flying with Pegasus, and it is safe to say that it’ll be our last experience. Pegasus bills itself as a “value airline” where passengers are expected to pay for the service they chose. However, all their service is for sale! From seat selection to luggage fees to snacks and beverages. With our most recent flight, we arrived at the airport almost 3 hours prior to our flight. The check-in desk had 2 agent when they had 2 flights scheduled (to Ankara and Antalya) We had paid luggage fees in advance prior to arrival to the airport but they still charged us for 2 bags that were 5 Kg overweight. But they did not take credit card at the check-in desk and we had to run to the ATM. The check-in process took us almost 2 hours to complete. Overall, our experience with Pegasus is it’s not worth the money!",10,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Another Good Flight","Another good flight with pleasant service by the in-flight attendants. Comfortable flight and reasonably on time.",10,"2018",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Good service comfortable flight","Good service & comfortable flight. The flight attendants were always helpful and the only delay was due to airport not the aircraft carrier",10,"2018",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Poor service but some staff are very helpful","I booked a flight from London to Elazig, the time delay was very long between connecting flights, on arrival I realised I could catch an earlier connecting flight even though the time was short, I asked at the Pegasus desk if I could get on the earlier flight, the young lady from Karakocan helped me she made sure my baggage was transferred to the earlier flight and took me to the check in point to make sure I caught the plane, we had to run all the way but it saved me a 12 hour wait. Pity the company does not have the same attitude as this young lady, she should be promoted. Thank you to her for her help.My experience of the staff in general is that some are very rude and others are helpful, there are far too many baggage checks, the airport scan bags then Pegasus open hand luggage bags and check again and scan mobile phones, if the checks are carried out properly there is no need for so many. The UK does one check.",10,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Good flight","Flight was just on time without delays to both directions. The crew was very polite. Leg room is not so comfortable but usual for economy class seats. And the price for my flights was pretty cheap, so I can recomended Pegasus",10,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","No frills flight","The crew are pleasant and helpful. They make a couple of trips with refreshments during the 4 hour flight.
Leg room is limited but not uncomfortable.
Flight in both directions was not full so able to spread out.
No in flight entertainment.",10,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Very reasonable price","I found Pegasus to be the most reasonable in comparison to other companies. The seats were a little small with not much leg room, but for 4+ hours and taking into account the price, I was happy. The price included a seat choice, hold luggage and food which is always extra with other companies, so has to be taken into consideration when choosing a flight.",10,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Not a great airline","This airline is the worst that I have flew with, the seats are not comfortable, the toilets are very small, the food and drinks on board are expensive. The baggage handlers are something else, there were 10 people in our party and out of 10 cases 5 were damaged making them unusable, 4 of the cases had not been used before. 1 case had a wheel broken off, another had the front pocket ripped off, another had a rip in the back and the sewn on luggage tag ripped and he 4th had the bars on the handle bent so that the handle would not lift out making it very awkward to pull the case.",10,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Good experience with Pegasus airlines","This is the first time I flew with Pegasus airlines. Flew frm AMS to Tbilisi via Istanbul and return. The aircrafts were new with good enough leg space. I didnt had to sit side-ways to adjust my legs.

Crew is professional and greeted with a smile.

There were 2 issues I see:

1. the seats cannot recline(the seats dont even have the button to recline the seats).

2. The seats dont have the space to keep you phone and other things. So it becomes very inconvenient to hold everything in your hands during the flight.

Overall I would not mind flying again with Pegasus. Its far better that some other low cost airlines like Easyjet and Ryan air.",10,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Best Airlines","One of the best airlines in term of services, the flight was very smooth, stable, I have bought XL seat with sandwich, the seat was exactly as choose in the website as well as the meat, the staff were very kind and helpful.
Thank you",10,"2018",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","I prefer Pegasus airlines most of the flights for domestic and international.","I am using this airline for almost 10 years. Even some of the services like luggage and meal are not free. So, the price of the flights cheaper than the others for most of the time. On the other hand, Pegasus having promotion flights and discounts frequently. The most important thing is I have not experienced much delays with this airline, recommend it.",10,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Pegasus review","Pegasus provides you with the low-cost feeling.
Not a drop of water without buying it, tight leg space and no opportunity to tilt the back of your seat for a four hours flight.
Pegasus is only usable for short flights > 2 hours maximum.
They were on time for both my flights with them. So no complaines wrt accuracy.",10,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","cancelling","Hello, we dont reccomend this company. When we tried to reach the helpdesk there was no reply for two days. Then we tried to reah the by call and finally we did that. We wanted change just the name of the traveller just first name and didnt want it. Only for 100% of the cancel fee. Thank you. Never again.",10,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","I URGE you to think very carefully before booking a flight with Pegasus Airlines even the CEO ignores your complaint!","My wife and I flew from Northern Cyprus, we took off on a 1hr 15min flight to Istanbul, 30 minutes in the captain informed us of fog at Istanbul and he hoped it would clear by the time we got there. Well I kinda hoped that the captain had checked before he took off that he would be able to land. Apparently not! As you guessed, we were unable to land at Istanbul so we were diverted to Ankara 350km in the opposite direction. After zero information and sitting in the plane on the stand at Ankara for 1hr 45mins we took off for Istanbul again this time the airport was open, he’d even checked!
Of course on arrival at Istanbul it transpired, not unsurprisingly that we had missed the connection flight to London Stansted. I can only describe what came next as pure chaos. First we were getting the next flight then we weren’t. But actually we were going to a hotel because there was no room on the next flight. After 2 hours of queuing, pushing, shoving and a lot of raised blood pressures we eventually got a voucher for a hotel and told (only by some very helpful English Turkish speaking Cypriots we would be catching the 11.10am flight the next morning. Information, guidance and help from the Pegasus staff was non existent, they are mostly rude, most can’t speak English and if you ask any of them who can they will plead ignorance.
Of course we now needed a visa to enter Turkey (not a requirement for Northern Cyprus) £25 each ‘on the door’ x 2 £50 out of pocket, 1 days work lost x 2, plus incidental costs as well. We had no luggage so had to buy a change of clothes each and some toiletries. I estimate Pegasus incompetence to have cost me upwards of £500 in total.
On arriving at the hotel it became evident that the bus driver had gone to the wrong hotel 30 mins in the opposite direction to the one we were booked into. Having caught the transfer from our holiday hotel at 3am we finally arrived at the correct hotel in Istanbul (1hr 15 min flight time away remember) at 4.30pm! On arrival back at the airport the next morning we were told after queuing up for over 1hr again by our English, Turkish speaking Cypriots (by this time friends), that the flight we had been re-booked on was full. The next flight was at 20.50 the same evening so we went back to the hotel! We wasted 36hrs with no apology, no empathy, no attempt to organise a replacement flight with another airline, no nothing!
We should have arrived back at London Stansted at 11am Sunday, finally got back at 11.15pm Monday.
I wrote an email of complaint to the CEO of Pegasus Airlines Mehmet Nane, I advise you not to waste your time. He, or I guess his office passed it to the customer service department who as I had already found out are not fit for purpose they offered a weak apology and 3000 reward points, asking me to get in touch so they could open me a reward points account, yes seriously. So I wrote again to the CEO suggesting he may like to re-consider his companies reply before I left feedback on my experience. This time he ignored me.
In summary, this is complete shambles of a company, they have scant regard for their customers and they treat you like animals taking no responsibility for their incompetence or mistakes. Their customer service is the worst ever and reflects their general attitude to their customers. Never ever again would I contemplate travelling with them and I will actively advise anyone else thinking of doing so. NOT TO!",10,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","The most Terrible airline !","_Our flight was not on time, we had a stop about 1 hour in ankara,but i became about 6 hours, they didn’t do anything to make as comfortable in airport they just gave passengers a terrible crapy sandwich!
_everything u ask in Airplane is gonna cost u a fortune,even water.
_flight are not on time",10,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","NEVER AGAIN!!!!","The worst airline ever. I don't recommend anyone to travel with this airline. It may look cheap but its not! They don't know how to treat passengers. When you check in the only thing they want from you is your money. They want to charge you for everything! I was traveling business class, and bought 30 kilos of luggage and I had the right of 12 kilo of cabin luggage. And the representative at the check in counter said I have only the right of 8 kilos for cabin luggage. And I showed him my ticket where it states that I have the right of 12 kilos for cabin luggage. But it was useless to speak to him! And if you have a connecting flights the charge for 1 extra kilo TWICE!!!! FIRST and LAST time traveling with this airline!",10,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst Airline I had the misfortune of travelling with","This is the worst airline ever, constant delays, rude staff, worst planes. They are just there to make money and don’t care about their customers. Only 20 kilo of baggage allowance and very expensive if you go over your allowance by 1 kilo. They charge you £5 for stale sandwich and £3 for bottles of water. The plane is cramped and to upgrade to a seat with 4inch extra legroom you have to pay £38.
3 flights with them and I had average 45 min delay on each. No blankets or pillows for a 5 hour flight. These guys have the monopoly at Sabia Airport, so they treat their customers with no respect. Try and avoid this airline by all means.",10,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Better than I was lead to bellieve","Quick check in polite staff flights on time . The staff on the plane were very nice cheerful and helpful . The seats are a bit narrow but not much of a problem. We had food on the plane this was very enjoyable over all no complaints",10,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Thanks God and Thanks Pegasus for Direct Flight from Moscow to Izmir","I am living in Moscow and my family lives in Izmir. I never understand why there is no any direct flight from Russia to Izmir despite there is a lot flight to Antalya and Dalaman. Thankfully this year Pegasus satisfied our request and they set a charter flight on daily basis for summer period. This is really amazing to be able fly directly and it takes only 3 hours and 15 minutes, no anymore suffer long queues in Istanbul passport control and no wait in Istanbul airport hours for domestic flight. Thanks to Pegasus. We wish this flights take place in autumn-winter and spring as well even if once a week.",10,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","So poor. I was afraid of my life.","First i must i bought an extra tickets due to a failure in their flypgs.com website and there was no considiration or any recognition at all.
Total ignorance. Not even a single clean airplane. That 8s amazing. No service even a glass of water.
Flight was so unstable. Never again.",10,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Fly Pigs (Pegasus/ Flypgs.com) where you work for them for free","We flew with Turkish airline Pegasus (flypgs.com) to Kyrenia, North Cyprus.Needless to say, we dubbed it Fly Pigs. The seats do not recline at all and are bone hard and covered in plastic leather. There are no useable pockets in the seat ahead so nowhere to put anything. Obviously this is deliberate. Fly Pigs is clearly the Turkish equivalent of Ryanair. We’d paid extra for extended legroom but discovered once on the flight that we were expected to be unpaid workers for Fly Pigs; not simply helping open exit doors in an emergency but actually doing it all yourself and then not using the exit but being expected to help staff disembark other passengers. If we didn’t verbally and immediately accept that unpaid employment we would be moved to seats with less legroom and no compensation. I’m seriously considering sending Fly Pigs an invoice, particularly as you are not specifically made aware of this unpaid employment when paying for the added legroom.

As we booked our holiday our travel company was very slow to reveal that the flights were not direct – indeed our hotel had a petition you could sign demanding direct flights – and we would have to land and change planes in Istanbul’s lesser international airport Sabiha Gokcen on both legs of the journey with additional delays and never-ending mind-numbingly overzealous security checks and pat-downs. Why the plane couldn’t just land and take off again I have no idea. And of course you have to rely upon the airport staff correctly unloading and reloading your check-in baggage (they did both ways, thankfully). This would all be fine but our Stansted to Istanbul plane was very slow to arrive at Stansted and eventually took-off 45 minutes late. Luckily the pilot made up the time and our 85 minute turnaround time was restored and our bags safely reloaded.

We left the UK at 2.45pm and eventually landed in Lefkosa, North Cyprus at 11pm local time (9pm UK time). A long journey of over 2,500 miles. We then had a two hour bus journey dropping-off here and there in a bus with completely inadequate suitcase storage. The driver ended up putting some suitcases, including mine, in the corridor between seats. Needless to say they all crashed forward every time the driver braked. I managed to prevent one actually landing on the driver. Health and Safety is not a big issue/any issue in North Cyprus. Pegasus is a budget airline pared down to the bone. Don't even buy an instant coffee unless you can get a mortgage, first.",10,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","not comfortable at all","we had a long flight by this air line and let me tell you that there was not any place for our feet and the snack they served was awful.

the crew did not know English well.
the plane itself was not a new one by the way.

according to the price, well it is economical so it depend on your purpose and pocket to choose it or not.",10,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Wont choose it again unless the price difference with other airlines is double","it is a ok flight for 1 hour travel. the seats are non recline able.i felt the seats are slightly narrow than normal flight.",10,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","do not waste your time with this airlines unless you want to experience horror...","ok where to start?
unprofessional, rude, canceling flight last minute, do not provide support for cancel flights ( cancel one leg of trip, and move for 9 hours without any support :( , leaving group of 16 people in transition area for hours to wait for any solution of situation), charging fees that can not be explained, requiring payments of hidden un explainable fees in cash, does not issue receipt for hidden fees, real road robbery...

in flight, this planes are packed with seats to the physical maximum of the plane, there is no log room at all, distance from one seat to back of the other seat is 14 cm!

"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst airline ever","This was one in f the worst flights I've had. We pre ordered hot breakfast which when it was just about warm on the outside and totally stone cold on the inside. My husband and I asked for it to be warmed again. When it arrived it was delivered being held in loads of tissues and we were told to be really careful because it was extremely hot. We started to eat and it was still only lukewarm but what it was is still a mystery, I think it was potatoe but it was a tasteless watery mess, I think it should have been scrambled egg but no one could describe it as that. We didn't eat the food.
There were lots of flies buzzing around and the smell from the toilets was awful. They kept spraying the toilet but within minutes the awful smell was back. The plane was quite dirty and we will not book with this airline again.",10,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Didnt feel like a customer who spent their money for the flight","Returning from Egypt back home to London, The airport staff were very rude and must have searched us three times before getting through and passports were checked several times, no one spoke a word of English, though German seemed to be the trend, nonetheless, not really holding the Airline responsible for any of these,
When we finally got to the desk, we have one check in suitcase at 23kg (and all paid for in advance included luggage of 25kg).
The Airline staff told me that my luggage was over weight i.e. by 3 kg, I explained that I paid extra therefore er have 25kg as our total. She said ""no you dont"" then referred to my hand luggage and said ""you have 8kg each for the hand luggage not main luggage "" I repeated and said we have paid for our meals on the flight and also paid extra for our luggage to total of 25kg, we did the same thing on the way from London to Egypt, therefore repeated the process and simply paid twice for the return journey. Staff ignored said nothing. We waited at the counter for several minutes, not knowing what is going on, felt helpless in a foreign country, the staff was abrupt and unhelpful, then while later, a man came along looked at us, started to talk to someone and then took out a his phone few minutes later he said I owed him 75 euros, I said why? once I explained I paid for 25 KG and im not over the weight, this conversation played tennis for a few times, before the man looked at the screen and oh ok you have and waved me on, like a worthless person who was actually wasting his time.
The attitude of the was disgusting, Im in a front line role in the UK i see and deal with all sorts, I have never treated people in this manner, I certainly do not expect and airline staff to treat customers in this way .
So that we have gone through finally on the bus to the aircraft, when arrived by the aircraft on the ground airside, a man jumped on the bus and said, all passengers have to pick out your checked in luggage and put in the trolley so they can be loaded to the aircraft, so most of did, and some passengers didnt simply didnt understand it, dont blame them as this isnt a norm. The flight was delayed almost an hour due to the confusion, and suppose one of us got injured trying lift up luggage on the ground what would have happened then?
I have never used this Airline before therefor can not tell whether this is an isolated incident in particular at Hurgada airport, but this is not an what customers should be put through.",10,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","bad experience","The flighth was delayed by about two hours without explaining the reason of the delay, and the plane crew did not even give us a glass of water to make up for the delay, while the airport management used to send us from one gate to another",10,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Changing Planes","Flew from Stansted to Izmir where we had to change planes in order to fly to Nicosia.having made this flight about 14 times,we are quite used to it.However you used to sit on the plane and await take off for about 40 minutes,now you have to leave the plane enter the departure lounge and wait for about an hour before taking off again for Cyprus.The only benefit I can see is that it gives you the opportunity to stretch your legs and if you are a smoker the chance to have a cigarette in the smoking lobby in the airport.Timewise it is about the same journey time if you fly to Larnaca and then drive to the North.",10,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Rude","I know the saying ,you get what you pay for, but come on !
I sat in row A seats a and b , they now have a partition in front of these seats so how they class these as extra leg room is beyond me.
Separating the galley from the seated area of the aircraft is a curtain which the cabin crew loved to open and close almost every few minutes , what they are doing behind the curtain is a mystery !
The cabin crew are rude and abrupt, I flew London to Istanbul , Istanbul to Dalaman and the same on the return.
The prices on board are so expensive, it's a wonder they sold anything when the drink and food trolly came along.
I will never fly Pegasus again.",10,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","On time flights minus the comfort","Again boarded the airline of our choice for a holiday in Turkey from Doha. All aspects of the airline was fine except for the fact that an international flight does not have the option to recline the seat even a bit- no push button. Whereas the domestic flights we took in Turkey had this option. Even a shuttle bus seat has this option and is standard. Agreed this is a budget no frills airline, but basic comfort is expected from the passengers who take this airline.Six months earlier when i took the same route this was not the case though.",10,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","a means to an end.","pegasus is a no frills budget airline, very uncomfortable seats, nothing to do just a very boring flight. its just a way to get to north cyprus via change of plane in sabia gocken in istanbul. was much better when you could just stay on the plane, but not anymore you have to get of and walk all the way through the airport which is a long walk and find the gate for your next flight down to ercan. wouldnt advise doing it this way again.",10,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Affordable Flights","I chose Pegasus Airlines because i needed an affordable flight for my trip to Rome. I was very satisfied with the price, i saved 50% compared to a straight flight. They get four stars and not five for 3 reasons: 1- there were some delays, it could be out of there control but i would never know. 2- the flight attendants are not the happiest, they looked over worked, bored and almost never smiled. 3- for some reason the aircrafts used for flights from and to Doha, Qatar didn’t have inclining seats which was super annoying. That being said, will i use this airline again? Yes, the savings are worth it.",10,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Budget airline, akin to Ryanair","Pegasus is a budget airline with a no frills service. There's only economy class and meals/snacks are only available for a further payment. Not much legroom. They seem very tough on overweight and oversize cabin luggage. They made a big thing of coming round to inspect luggage while people were waiting at the gate. Several people's baggage was refused and they were told they had to pay an additional fee. Fair enough, each bag was clearly over their size limit.",10,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Terrible experience","I took the flight from Antalya to Geneva. Inflight service was less than average and very expensive compared to other low cost airlines. On arrival to Geneva, my suitcase arrived completely broken. I reported it and was told to contact the airline. They offer 350 liras (approx 40 euros) as compensation which does not cover the handles of the suitcase. Ridiculous for such a big suitcase. Even in Turkey, the worst quality suitcase of this size costs above 80 euros 😂. I decided to help the airline, give them a gift of 350 liras. They need it more than I do.....definitely airline to avoid.",10,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Comfortable","Flying with Pegasus Airlines for the second journy / holiday to Bodrum in Turkey is great experience to have, Pegasus team is very helpful and always smiling, flights scheduled always on time, they are always very welcoming on board and flying with Pegasus is amazing, also the website and App miss nothing to provide about your flight and always you can get a good offers ;)

"Pegasus-Airlines","Economic flight with reasonable service for a price","This flight was part of a 3 flight journey, with this being the middle flight.
Standard flight, no reclining seats, space ok since the seat pocket is above and not knee-high.
Service by cabin crew and check in desk good.

All on board is for a price but that you know up front. Menu is ok, nothing fancy which is not expected on these flights.
No in flight entertainment, so bring your own.

We departed with a little delay.

The 2nd flight from Pegasus had a long delay and announcements on Istanbul were terrible so you don't know what was going on, but that's an airport thing.",10,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Take away the Pegasus logo from such a poor service.","First of all, I still cannot imagine that I travelled for 1 hour and 25 minutes without getting even a sip of water; though the flight was not cheap!! Secondly, the air hosts were (selling) coffee, water, food and desserts on a trolley in a form of a moving cantine; the thing that I have never seen in my life. Moreover, everybody was rigid the thing that I touched explicitly while in Turkey. Finally, I still cannot understand why a Turkish Airlines would choose Pegasus as their emblem?! Pegasus is a Greek mythical creature who happens to be the offspring of Poseidon and Medusa. Poseidon is a first class Greek god of the Olympic Pantheon. He is the brother of Zeus and Hades/Pluto. In addition, he is the uncle of Athena, Apollo, Artemis, Heracles, Dionysus and others of the Greek gods, goddesses and heroes. On the other hand, Medusa was another mythical creature from the family of the gorgons (mermaids are from the same family & this highlights the connotation between Poseidon as the sea god-king and the gorgons.) Now, what's the point of Turkey taking a Greek mythical creature and connoting it to such a poor service. I definitely don't recommend these Airlines.",10,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Pegasus Airlines","This flight is a good price, but there is no service unless you want to pay $$$$$. No complementary water, drinks or snacks.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Very disappointed!","I probably had the worst service ever in my life.
Booked my mom for a business class making sure she is comfortable because she recently had a knee surgery. Before booking I called Pegasus office located in Muscat to make sure if they airport services such as small inside airport car to take my mom faster to the gate. She said yes it is available so I proceed with the payment online. Then I got to know they won’t be offering any service EVEN if I make an extra payment for it....
Also, by mistake I selected a different seat. Wanted to change the seating right after I proceed with the payment. Right after the booking I called Pegasus office in Oman the lady told me on the phone she can’t help me with anything...

So this is what you get with cheap airlines...

"Pegasus-Airlines","Problematic aircraft air-conditioning","We wanted to save on the airfare, thus booked the flights both ways with Pegasus with a short stop in Istanbul. The aircraft were Airbus A320-200 and A320-800, both not very old. We expected narrow leg space which materialized big time. The seats are also hard and uncomfortable. The air-conditioning on the four flights was not functioning well at all and I do not know if it is because of the system maintenance or because they try to save. When asking for paper towels (empty in the toilets), I was amazed on the flight attendant answer, claiming they run out of it...",10,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Budget flight, it does what it says on the tin! (Gets you from A to B)","The service and efficiency of this airline I could not fault. We flew from Stansted to Istanbul. Both flights arrived on time although one did take off late. We ordered our food in advance and it was perfectly edible and served on time. The late night flight back from Bahrain I would not bother ordering food as it was flying into the night. The plane was clean and the staff were polite. I have one major complaint and that was that the seats were so so uncomfortable. It was impossible to get any sleep and certainly my back ached after both flights. The seats do not recline and the arm rests were hard.
Apart form that we got what we paid for. Bucket price bucket class!",10,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Total disappointment","Ticket was from Doha to Mineralnye Vody with transfer in Istanbul. I bought this ticket because of my friend who offered to take a walk in Istanbul. So we bought this ticket with 15 hours transit. Since we were leaving Qatar after 2 years we’ve got some extra luggage. After investigation of fees for overweight we headed to the airport and there we were told the price for overweight 3 times higher if that mentioned on their website. They told us airport fees are different. Ok, for this I can admit we should’ve checked info better.
We landed in Istanbul having no troubles during the flight. Everything was great! We’ve realized our plans of visiting Hagia Sophia and some other places. The main problem occurred while boarding. Can you imagine boarding wasn’t even announced but staff started checking boarding passes of passengers who were in waiting area. When it was finally announced and it was almost our turn for checking one guy came and said to other staff check the hand luggage. Seriously! After almost everyone passed! So when they reached us our luggage was exceeding since we bought some staff from duty free. Food is not included in, so we took some snacks and gifts. It was 10 kg instead of 8 allowed. So, they told us we should pay 20$ for 1 kg extra. In total for me and my friend they charged 80$. I was so angry because I distinctly remember there was a group of few guys who had each the bag bigger than mine and even one of them had camping backpack. It was huge and full. It was obvious overweight. But instead of listening to me they were busy trying to convince us we’d miss the flight if we don’t pay now. One of the guys started to be rude. 2 full buses of passengers already left and there was 3rd waiting for us and one more couple which they weren’t allowing to leave. In the end we’ve decided to pay. We and that couple gave them by 100$. That was looking silly when they started to look for a change trying to ask passengers waiting for other flights. After unsuccessful attempts they started panicking discussing whether its’s their responsibility to charge. So unprofessional: they don’t even know their responsibilities and created situation for flight delay for 20 mins. In the end they gave us back money and we finally boarded frustrated. Everyone was on their seats already staring at us. Flight attendants were in hurry checking luggage almost knocking me down.
The worst first experience with Pegasus. Never had such situation flying with other airlines. There’s no proper service, rude staff not knowing their responsibilities, overpriced menu. Yes ticket price’s cheap and I it makes clear what kind of service you’ll receive. Don’t recommend.",10,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Excellent value for money","We usually check in online but unfortunately Pegasus do not offer this option for Manchester airport. Probably due to it being a Turkish airline. We arrived early and check in was quite slow but ok. The staff were friendly and everything ran smoothly. When we went to the departure lounge we realised that there must be a delay although the plane was already there. Our flight was due to depart at 09.20 and by this time it was already 09.15. We were called to board and this went smoothly. We took off around 10.10. The flight was a bit bumpy due to weather conditions and the plane was quite old but clean. We made up some time and landed approximately 30 minutes late.",10,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","There are better budget airlines out there.","You get what you pay for, and possibly a little less.
In this review I’m gonna touch on a couple of different point.
1. Ticket pricing.
2. Quality of airpline.
3. Service on airplane.
4. Quality of airport for transit.
I’ve been doing a couple of reviews recently, since I’ve flown a lot, and I just finished my third flight between Dubai and Copenhagen transitting in Istanbul Sabiha Gokcen skriv navn på lufthavn flying with Pegasus, and it will probably be my last with this company. I will explain why in the following.
1. Pricing.
This is the obvious reason for flying with Pegaus. I paid 180USD from Dubai to Copenhagen, and I ordered the ticket 4 days in advance. I get these tickets on Momondo.com or skyscanner.com. This included 20kg of check in luggage.
2. Quality of airplane:
The airplanes that Pegasus airlines provide are probably the worst quality airplanes I’ve flown with. Honestly they’re not much worse than most other budget airlines, but, the seats in their planes doesn’t even recline, there’s no extra cupholder, no powerplug, no nothing but the very seat you sit in and the belt that ties you to it. Non-reclining seats, at least for me, gets annoying when you do flights that lasts for more than a couple of hours, as I like to sleep on the planes.
Note. This happened to me on 4/5 flights. One of the flights there were nice leather seats that reclined, so they must have a varied fleet.
3. Service on airplane:
Again, it’s a budget airline, so I didn’t expect much and neither should you. You can buy food and beverages on flight, but you won’t get anything for free. From my experience, the staff onboard is not specifically instructed to smile, or be polite to the customers. They’re definitely not rude in any way, but they also don’t cater to you, like many other airlines do. Even budget ones.
Also, this is the first company where I have experienced, that no one was allowed to wear headphones upon landing. I really don’t see the logic behind it, especially not since we were allowed to wear them upon takeoff.
4. Quality of transitting airport:
So when I fly from Copenhagen to Dubai, I always transit in Istanbul Sabiha Gokcen.
It’s not a specifically bad airport. If you’re into shopping there’s quite a lot of tax free stuff and a few clothing stores as well as lots of cafes and fast food joints. However, when I transit somewhere, the number one thing I value is free Wifi! And this airport doesn’t have it. You can buy acces to Wifi for a premium, but me flying on a budget, I didn’t want to do that. There are a couple of powerplugs around in the airport that you can get if you are lucky. That’s always a plus in my book.

Summarizing:
If you’re on a budget, this might be an ok airline for you, however, I personally believe that there are better options out there. I recently made a review on Aeroflot, whom I recently flew with, and was very pleasantly surprised with. They are at almost exactly the same pricepoint as Pegasus, and they provide a far greater service both in terms of staffing, quality of airplane, and quality of transitting airport. Moscow airport has free wifi ",10,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Amateurs at the game","We flew with Pegasus to Northern Cyprus. Second class service all the way. Firstly taking advantage of their pre order menu, I ordered Mushroom Risotto and my wife Chicken Schnizal . My Risotto came as Ravioli and the Chicken as a burnt offering. That was on the way out. On our return we decided to choose from the flight menu, but being in row 20 we were served last, guess what nothing left. Perusing the duty free list we decided to buy some Gin £11 litre. Guess what sold out. If this airline wants to compete in the real world then they need to pull their socks up smarten themselves up and get their act together.",10,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","overally good","its low cost airlines but the service is not that bad, take off is always on time, they offer food service but you have to pay however they have good selections. they offer very cheap flights time to time.",10,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","You get what you pay for","Cheap airline, don’t expect too much.
Delays are frequent.

Flights overall was correct, plane was clean . Only economy tickets are available on this trip .

Customer service is very poor . No one can give you an update regarding delays and you wait for a long time after the schedule time to get a final gate number .

Wouldn’t recommend but if you are on a budget then it will work for you.",10,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Cheap flight","Worst flight, I’ve never been so humiliated. It was not clear to me how much luggage was allowed on the plane. Was impossible to get a hold of the airline to find out. Ended up having to pay 300 Euros for 20KG",10,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst on-board service and treatment","This is the worst airline I have travelled on in a 30+ years, their 737-800 are narrow, has rigid seating with no on-board entertainment (not even a map giving information where the plane is heading). Worst yet is how they treat their passengers, no food or drinks are served; they charge 10 Turkish Lira for a bottle of water that costs a mere one Lira.
Consider what happend on my flight. One person fill ill and vomitted near the plane bathroom. The cabin crew asked him to clean the mess himself and pack the stuff in a plastic bag and was requested to take the garbage bag with hime upon leaving the airplane.",9,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Not as comfy","In general the flight was good. The service was not as expected because if you book a flight it is supposed to have one meal free or even a bottle of water and the pegagus airlines didn't offered this service and we should have to pay if we wanted something",9,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Delays both ways","Late boarding, then one hour on the plane with nothing happening, no explanation. Massive delay for a two hour flight, hardly seems worth it.",9,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","This Airline is getting better !","I have used this service a few times and it was not the best not a patch on TK the aircraft were old and the staff rude with little English however the aircraft are now new and the staff are really trying to welcome you and the standard of service offered for the price is good.
The imigration Q at SAW is awful as is the inbound Duty Free - that is a joke 2 check out staff and about ten standing about doing nothing - but on those two points no one does anything so I wont go there !",9,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Flights to Northern Cyprus","Flights quick to Ercan from Antalya but delays by 1 hour on both trips. Had left enough time for ongoing flight to UK but worth noting. Nice planes. Friendly staff.",9,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Adana flight - good leg room","Booked and checked in online with Pegasus, without difficulty. We were given two random seats at the back of the plane and when we asked if we could change our seats at drop off, were told we couldn't change our seats as we had checked in online. No matter as it was only a very short flight. We were pleasantly surprised to find that we had plenty of leg room. The check in and security from the outward journey was good, but on the return journey it seemed to be very random, There were people carrying too many bags, more than their allocation and which looked heavy, and taking up too much of the locker space. Luckily for us we boarded the plane early when there was still space. There was a lady travelling with her three children, all sitting in a 'three' seat. The stewardess said that one of the children should move to the spare seat next to the aisle, but did not enforce this and one of the younger children, even though she was older than 2 travelled on her mother's lap. The stewardess passed by her a few times but just looked the other way. I don't feel this was safe and it makes a mockery of 'belting up'. The return journey was delayed by one hour.",9,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","My experience with Pegasus Airlines","It was my first time to travel to Istanbul on Pegasus Airlines. The plane was relatively new ( Boing 737-800) and I had to pay for the extra long seats at the first row. Of course it was a cheap flight and I had to pay for even a bottle of water. The flights were smooth on both directions however an old female flight attendant on my flight from Dammam to Istanbul intentionally locked the front toilet in order for her and her assistant to use it where I had to ask them to open for me.",9,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","NEVER BOOK ONLINE TICKET","The online service is terribly disorganized. they deducted the amount from my account and no ticket is issued. after calling for 5 days they said you will refunded within 10 days without any compensation.",9,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Izmir flight","Booked extra legroom, had front row seats. You get a bit more legroom but not loads as it is a small plane - 737-800

They now offer duty free on board as well as food etc, airline prices to be expected.

We had checked in baggage, 4kg overweight on return but we didn’t get charged :)

I don’t like the fact they seem to let any shape/size of hand luggage. Some people had bags big enough for a 2 week holiday trying to squeeze them into the overhead locker.

Overall better experience than Ryan Air for a budget airline.",9,"2018",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Never book a ticket with this company","Never book a ticket with this company. I have made two separate bookings for my trip, I have been charged twice for one ticket and the other one has been charged but I have never received the confirmation. Getting through customer service is almost impossible, when you get to contact them by phone they ask you to open a request online, which they never solved. They have told me I will received my refund in 7 days, it's been more than 20 and I'm still waiting. I have asked to rebook my ticket then with the money they already charged me and they say it's not possible, I need to pay again and wait for the refund of the other ticket. Horrible customer service.",9,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","If there is no online check in....","If there is no online check in, then Pegasus will almost certainly weigh your hand luggage. The limit is 8kg, and I was measured at 8.5kg. I was allowed to go and take stuff from my luggage and put it into my pockets and rejoin the queue to avoid a surcharge. I understand there are rules and budget airlines make money from excess baggage charges. The fight did arrive safely and on time which is the primary measure of my satisfaction.",9,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Extremely Rude Un-helpful Staff at airport and customer service","I have an assistance dog (support animal) I needed urgently to get to Izmir, I rang the customer service number telling them I needed to trave but also it was essential I took my little ESA dog with me.The advisor carefully took all information and went to check with his manager, after quite a long hold he retutrned telling me this was no problem and to I could go ahead and book.. This I did I was then told to go into manage my booking and go to add a dog I complied with this and completed whilst the advisor was on the phone. I then booked my return flight and was told I had to pay 36 euro for Tilly and 40 euro for the outward journey but to pay this at airport. Great were all ready for the off got all necessary jabs paper work etc had the correct pet carrier for the plane every thing I could possibly do was put in place. Owing to the nature of my dissability it was essential I asked a PA to take me to the airport and check I booked in etc. My PA agreed taking into account this was a Sunday three plus hour drive and a 6am start it was to cost me double time . Arrived a Stanstead Airport on Sunday 23rd September 2018 at approx 9.30am..At the check in desk a chap who said he works for Pegasus says really sorry but its Stanstead Airport policy NO DOGS ALLOWED REGARDLESS so basicly no ESA dogs or support animals. He then took the information off me went behind the check in desk came back and said its not Pegasus we have no problem with you traveling with the dog it is the airport policy. After quite a while he eventually got me a airport security manager. Very helpful polite chap checked all paper work and said and I quote THIS IS A SUPPORT ANIMAL WITH ALL THE RIGHT PAPER WORK WE HAVE TO ALLOW HER ..The chap from Pegasus says ok get paper work back come over to me and I will issue your ticket.. Back at the check in desk I am told sorry its not Stanstead policy but Pegasus policy no dogs on the flight. The staff at the checkin I persume where female managers were rude and so terribly unhelpful they did not even look at me when speaking had there back to me all the time.. I asked for the manager whom apparantly was siffting the infomation to talk to me was told she will not talk to you.. I then rang the customer service was put on hold for approx 30 mins told they would ring me back never did. I showed e-mails confirming my flight and the fact I was taking a dog, I was told this had come from KIWI now KIWI obviously work on behalf of Pegasus so third party or not they should both sing from the same hymn sheet.I was then told I get an e-mail on the 4th Sept telling me the booking was cancelled yet I was still booked on and so was my dog. I did never receive this e-mail. After nearly three hours of been lied to and listened to the buck been passed from A TO B and back again I came home. I intend to sue Pegasus for the horrific distressing time I have had to endure my dissability is badly effected with stress so you can imagin the state I arrived home in",9,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","You get what you pay for","This low cost carrier was the only budget option for Doha to Istanbul, Turkey. If you can look past the almost non-existent customer service, it is worth taking the flight. Do remember that it is a budget airline, so better expect nothing. Some have no problems on their flight but on both of my flights with them, there was something to shake your head about. On the flight back to Doha, the cabin was so hot and the flight attendants werent even helpful about it.",9,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Most uncomfortable flight of my life","We flew to North Cyprus for 11 nights and had to stop at Istanbul to transfer to another plane before continuing our journey to Ercan airport.
The seats are all so close together and my knees were practically touching the back of the seat in front of me ( thank goodness I'm only 5'5""!)
There is next to no padding in the seats and I thought I might end up with a pressure sore I was that uncomfortable!
On our return journey we went through security immediately we entered Ercan airport and again once checked in.
We arrived at Istanbul for our transfer and went through stringent security checks including being patted down and swabs being taken of our bags so you would expect your baggage to be intact when collecting it at Stanstead? After all the checks surely if anything appeared suspicious it would've been picked up at Ercan or Istanbul?
Not in my case. We waited at baggage claim at Stanstead to see parts of peoples baggage come round on the belt and another bag with clothing hanging out.
My bag arrived and the padlock had been completely removed.There was no sticker on my bag to say why my bag had been broken into and on opening my bag I found my clothes to be soaked in a strange smelling substance.
This was not a toiletrie leak (there weren't any in my bag) I asked at the airport why this might of happened and was told possibly something looked odd going through the x ray so the padlock was smashed off but that does not explain the wetness all over my clothing.
I understand Pegasus are a budget airline but flying for over 4hrs in a sardine tin is just not worth it to me.
I will never fly with this airline again.",9,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Late on both ways","Good plane , nice crew who is seek to help but !!! We had a delay on both ways from and too amman !!! The captain on the plane apologied but it gave me bad expression although i like those economy airlines Other than saving money , always their crews are much better than famous airlines .",9,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Expensive drinks","Uncomfortable seats, expensive drinks ..2 small beers 1 small bottle wine £15.00! Translation from turkish to English not very good.",9,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Zeer goed","Great service. My previous flights were not that well to Iran but this time was great.
Super kind are Turkish people. Mega friendly and helpful... food service was nice as well
It was really goed!
We were happy",9,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","short flight to cyprus from turkey","short 40 minute flight was very comfortable.The staff just had time to get round with coffee but in all very nice flight",9,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Pegasus airlines OK","One hour flight was comfortable, and perfect landing in windy weather. Pegasus airlines do not serve free drinks or meals during the flight.",9,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Below Basic","Cons:
1. The seat did not have a seat push back button that allows you to incline it a little bit and have a nap.
2. The worst landing I have ever experienced. Was really dangerous.
3. Since they have long flights, they should introduce screens integrated into the seats, but watching is against a fee.
4. You cannot have a mix of international and domestic flights under one reservation. You need to make them separately. Accordingly, you need to collect your luggage and then check it again for the connection domestic flight.

Pros:
1. Quite cheap. I could not find any other option for the same destination that is even close to their price.
2. Departure timing is perfect.
3. They offer flexible changes and refund for ""Business Flex"" category tickets, which is very close in price from the strict one. This is a privilege that you usually cannot find in economy airlines.",9,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","kids are running around during flight!","All was well until the flight got in the air. After we were in the air for about 30 minutes several children started to run around and make noise. when they were not running around they were crying heavily and making noise. The service people did not seem to care neither did the parents until I asked one of the servicepersons to look into the matter. They asked me as if I were disturbed!! I said yes. Are you not? I understand children wil make noise, but they cannot be let running around the plane and making a lot of noise! disturbuing the whole plane... by the way you have to pay for water also.. so make sure you have money with you...",9,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Basic airline","This was my first time flying with Pegasus the staff were friendly and had no problems only a 20 minuite delay on one flight out of four. It’s a Cheap and basic airline the plane didn’t have much space or electronics but that was to be expected. Okay for short flights.",9,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Turkey to Northern Cyprus","Flying from Turkey to Northern Cyprus used to be slightly complicated, as you had to fly to Istanbul first. Not any longer; Pegasus now fly direct from Izmir to Ercan, and the flight takes just 75 minutes. The flights were on time too,and with a 20kg baggage allowance. Well done, Pegasus.",9,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Shock and Crisis began at Check in","Pegasus Airlines was such a huge disappointment, on my departure from Tbilisi where I had spent 6 months. The shock and crisis began when I went to the check in counter to check in my luggage. On the website trip.com it had different information about charges for excess baggage but the Georgian check in staff insisted on something I had no idea about.

My two suitcases came to 45 kg and for the extra weight, they asked me to pay 225 euros (GEL 700). I did not have a credit card and this was an unfair amount to pay for a cheap ticket - I paid GEL 300 for a one way ticket to Izmir and now with the payment, for the extra baggage, it came to GEL 1000....!!!! does this even make sense? What's the use of buying a cheap ticket and then paying the extra GEL 700 for baggage? I might as well have paid GEL 1000 to another airline.

Major airlines usually charge a flat rate of USD 100 which is fair. If Pegasus had charged me a rate in Georgian Lari, then I would have paid. But 225 euros is robbery and a total rip off.

I could not check in my second suitcase and was forced to leave it in the Left Luggage Room at the Arrivals Hall at the Tbilisi Airport. Being in a shock, and now thrown into a crisis, and not wanting to miss my flight to Izmir, I had no choice but to rush and quickly sort out the suitcase so it can be stored at the Left Luggage Room. The lady there gave me a form and then i left - only to realize when I was in the air, that I had all my important documents left in that suitcase which I left in the Luggage Room but it was too late. I only checked in one suitcase and was not charged anything.

The flight from Tbilisi was delayed for another hour or two - waiting seemed endless. The flight was so crowded. Food is sold on board but I had no appetite after the crisis this airline threw me in. I was just devastated and but could not do anything.Now I am left with booking another flight to go back to Tbilisi, pay for the storage and get my suitcase.

I do not recommend this airline no matter how desperate you are! Rather pay a little more to another airline, and get better service. I also suggest you check with the airline office about extra luggage before you leave.",9,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Flights to Antalya, Turkey","We took this flight on the 15th of september. Flight was on time and the crew were all the time whether we needed anything. We were very satisfied with everything on the flight.",9,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Great Airline","We used Pegasus for a week in Northern Cyprus. Flew from Antalya. Comfortable seating, friendly staff and flights were on time both ways. Online check in was a waste of time. We printed our boarding passes at home, but still had to queue for ages at bag drop and were given another set of boarding passes there.",9,"2018",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","if very cheap go for it","no TV , no free food , commercial airline where you have to purchase anything on an airplane, small planes, not clean ,seats are small. i would only recommend it if its ticket is very cheap comparing to other airlines.",9,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","The online check in does not work. The airline denies it.","The flight started in a negative way. As I had only a carry on bag I just wanted to check in online and go to passport control directly avoiding the long que for checkin.
Unfortunately the system decided that my documents are not appropriate for entry to Turkey. I have done online check ins several times with the same documents before with various airlines including Pegasus.
I tried the call center and had the same result. The lady at the call center insisted that my passport is not valid (!!!).
On my return flight the same thing happened and the system decided that my documents are not valid to return to my home country (!).
Eventually I had to go for manual check in waiting in the que. While purchasing my ticket I had paid extra for seat reservation and I had a PAID SEAT which was not given to me. The explanation was ""due to aircraft model change"" which was not true.
When I insisted on my seat or a refund they directed me to the call center.
Anybody with the strong enough nerves can try it. I quit.",9,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Never again.","Check in was a nightmare with check in staff telling us to pay an extra 25 dollars as we had sports equipment in our luggage, even though we were well within our 20kg allowance! They also refused to issue any receipts for the extra payment.
On board the plane only added to the nightmare, the interior appeared to have been neglected and was rather smelly, the carpets looked as though they had not been cleaned since the day it was built.
Then we come to the staff on board, they were not in the least polite and I think they would only have been happy had the plane had no flyers at all.
We did not try the food on board so it would be unfair to make derogatory comments about the quality of it. We did purchase a coffee which was in a very small paper cup which was only half filled (safety reasons) and cost 5 euros.
A very unpleasant experience both on the ground and in the air.
We contacted their customer services once back home, they were as helpful as pneumonia in an asthma ward.",9,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","reliable","A low cost company well organized and reliable, on time.
In general a good service.
I felt very safe.",9,"2018",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Good in parts","Pegasus seems to be under pressure as far as check-ins are concerned so it was lucky we followed their instructions and got there 3 hours before the flight. I have yet to work out how they measure cabin luggage as some passengers seem to have cases that should be in the hold. Our travel agents had asked for assistance for my wife. At Stansted we were asked to find the assistance desk ourselves by the check-in agent. We did so and eventually were allocated a wheel chair and taken to the plane. Pegasus have new Airbus aircraft but they area pretty tight fit for seating and as it was a Friday pm flight to Istanbul Sabiha Gokcen it was full. The flight was uneventful.There are no videos or piped music so you have to provide your own ways of passing the time. You can purchase meals or snacks and hot and soft drinks/beer/wine. There are no complimentaries. Info from the pilots/crew is pretty sparse except for the safety briefings. At Gokcen we were unloaded via the disabled persons platform as I was allowed to accompany my wife. We were impressed by the efficiency and cheerfulness of the young lad who steered the electric powered wheelchair provided for my wife, guiding us through control desks and the crowded concourse at good speed and delivering us to our departure gate for Cyprus and our onward journey. The flight to Cyprus was a carbon copy of our flight from Stansted but much shorter and we arrived in Ercan on time. Again we were met with a wheelchair for my wife. We then collected our luggage and taken to our hotel buses in the carpark. No frills, seating a bit tight, transfer time likewise but nothing really to complain about.",9,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Does what it says on the tin","Nothing spectacular but then again nothing bad.

Flights were on time although chaotic on the way back as gate was changed with no announcement.

Plane back was old and anyone over 5’6 was doubled over as the leg room was very minimal.

Would I fly them again? Yes, it was convenient for the part of Turkey I needed however it’s no thrills. Staff were pleasant enough and there were no dramas.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Horrible flight!","The flight is more than 3 hours between Istanbul and Barcelona. However even water service is with charge, a small water bottle is EUR 1,50. No need to say the seats are super cramped, maximised to accept more customers. As a 6'1"" (185 cm) tall person, I couldn't sleep a moment. Short flights and long haul flights should have a difference in the service.",9,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Very bad","This is really a low class airline company. There is no room for your feet, there is absolutely no service on the airplane.
The flight was delayed when I went to Turkey.
On the return flight, they had problems with an emergency door. We sat waiting on the aeroplane for 1 1/2 hour before they decided to move us to another aircraft. There we waited for another hour before we were allowed take off.
During this time we were served nothing!
When the plane finally took off and had reach service height. We were served a cheap bread with nougat inside and a bottle of water!!!!!!
Never again!",9,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Low cost Brussels to Antalya and back","Low cost bringing you from A to B at a cheap price but everything else has to be paid (luggage, drinks, food, ...). Cabin crew has to sell constantly. Almost no time between two flights so cabin is poorly cleaned. We were lucky because all flights were on time. We checked in very early so we got two seats in the exit row with more legroom free fo charge.",9,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Cheap and fine","a basic service, which was very cheap. zero food or drink (unless purchased), minimal luggage allowance, basic aircraft with no entertainment
usual basic uncomfortable seating
arrived on time, so overall all is well",9,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Reasonable replacement to the deceased Monarch airline.","Popular destination that previously been covered by Monarch. With the death of Monarch other airlines hiked up their prices on this route. Pegasus was reasonably priced. Comfortable seats with reasonable leg room. Friendly staff though a bit disorganised. Basic snacks available on flight. Worth considering if you intend to use this route. We would use again.",9,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","low cost airline, good quality","Comfortable seats. good quality for low price. Food and drinks are for extra dollars on the plane
Attendants are nice and friendly.
No respect for cabin baggage capacity. some people had more than what was allowed, which resulted in no space for people with one handbag to put their luggage.",9,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","The worst Airlines ever","Stay away from this airlines, they turned off the AC while all passengers were on board till flight took off. We were suffocating !",9,"2018",1

"Pegasus-Airlines","rude ground staff, delayed flight","The male staff member at the check-in counter at the airport was not polite enough when he asked the ladies traveling with me to check their identities.Then we went to another lady employee who was very kind and helpful.
Also there was a delay in our flights for more than 1 hour and we didn't hear any apology from the airline and they didn't even serve water after all that delay. They even charge for water.",9,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","London to Izmir direct flight","This September we flew from London Stansted airport on a direct flight to Izmir Turkey. The service is extremely good from booking to online check-in to arrival. We took the option of booking seat, meal and baggage allowance, which compared to many other companies is very reasonably priced. The flight crew are always very helpful and courteous and to be honest I wouldn’t consider flying to Turkey with anyone else.",9,"2018",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Terrible","Long waiting in Vienna, overbooked in the middle (Istanbul), bad service, small leg room, everything payable...",9,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","On time and good service","On time and good service, the seets are prety small and not much space for long legs. for short flights is´t okey.",9,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","I could not fit into the seat","We all know low-cost airlines - but Pegasus offered me so long the smallest legroom. My knees have continusly in touch with the seat in front of me - making the whole travel painful. I am 184 cm tall - I would say dont go with them if you are above 175. The staff were also not so nice. I would not call them rude, but you know, when all smile is very fake and you get no attention at all. On board there were no movies, no nothing. You stare ahead and suffer - this is how you fly with this company. I have paid the electronic check-in- only to receive a mail upon return flight morning that there was some electrical problem and because of this they cannot check me in - they suggest to go to the airport somewhat sooner. Well thank you Pegasus - I would never ever go with you.",9,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Good service for a reasonable price","The company provides good service for a reasonable price. The food was not included in the ticket price. But it wasn't a problem cause flight duration was about 1 hour 50 minutes. It is a lowcoster and people should understand it when choosing the airline. I often use Pegasus Airlines for family travellings. I am satisfied with this company.",9,"2018",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Experienced short delay - but the seats are leather and comfortable.","The trip is short - 70min. Drinks or food are not free during flight. But the ticket is cheap, and seats are comfortable. No complain here.",9,"2018",4

"Pegasus-Airlines","Good servise for a nice price","Good service, a lot of attractive disconts. All you need is to be attentive about the size of your luggage",9,"2018",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Never again","Pegasus was the cheapest option, but I don't want to experience that level of uncomfortable travel again. The last leg aboard their B737 Istanbul to Abu Dhabi flight had extremely cramped, uncomfortable seating and they kept the cabin temperature high enough to maintain a slight sweat. It was the longest 4 hours I can remember! And good luck with their online service. I was lucky enough to get online and order meals for my wife and I, however no meals we're forthcoming and their credit card machine wouldn't accept any of my credit cards which I used prior and after the flight.
The cabin crew we're very nice and professional and is the only thing keeping my reveiw a two instead of one. So, if you're looking desperately to save some bucks go for it, but I would strongly advise having cash on hand (euros!) in case you want to buy food, etc. onboard and be ready for cramped seating in a too warm atmosphere.",9,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","SAW worst airport, Pegasus worst airline","Sabiha is the worst airport in organization I have seen. Pegasus are crooks sailing a drink of water at 4 Euros. Worst airline.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Good budget airline","On time, easy boarding, reasonable leg room. We opted to take our own food, but if you order on line reasonably priced.",9,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Fair service for the price","It was a good flight. I don’t know what people who fly pegasus keep complaining about. It is a low cost flight so don’t expect all the luxuries you’ll find in Turkish for instance. The flights (to Istanbul and back) were on time and terms were clear regarding luggage. Would definitely fly again with them.",9,"2018",5

"Pegasus-Airlines","Delays galore","I went to Hurghada travelling from Stansted last month. We had nothing but problems. The flight numbers and times were changed and we were not told. Only found out on the morning of travel. Staff on the check in desk were pleasant by the flight was delayed and no updates from the staff on the gate. They were rude. The airplane turn around time was quick but this meant they didn’t clean the plane and I was left with the passengers before rubbish in the back of the chair. Only a couple of chairs on the plane reclined which didn’t make sense. The crew were friendly. When we got to Hurghada we were two hours late and our suitcase wheel had been broken off. On the return journey we tried to check in online the day before but only part of our flight was showing (going via Istanbul). We could not check in on line and it would not tell us why. Only found out at the airport that again the flights had been changed. Flight delayed again!! Only time the flight did leave on time was our connecting flight from Istanbul to Stansted. Since being home I have been trying to contact Pegasus to report the damage to my case. It took over an hour to get the request for contact form sent and then I have only managed to send one email reply to them as the email comes up not recognised and the number they have on the website is never answered so I have not been able to claim for the damage through them.

I will not be flying with them again",9,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst airline","This was definitely the worst airline.. no English speaking staff on the Istanbul izmir flight
2hours delays and no one to assist
The most basic plane i ve ever seen",9,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Flying with cats.","Every summer we take our cats with us --back and forth-.The crew are helpful and love the cats who are no bother and quite used to it after six years of traveling.
We sit in the first row as there is more space and away from the other passengers-just incase one hates cats or allergic to fur!
The crew on this airline are always smiling, answer all the questions, help with luggage and they are all very beautiful-including the guys--. The food is not bad either, coffee is Ok too. Recommend this airline to what ever destination, won't be disappointed !",9,"2018",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Average Travel Experience","This is was the first time to try Pegasus Airlines, the plane is small and the Seat space is very small which make the travel experience is very hard and uncomfortable, Cabin Crew are not professional enough, cannot use this Airlines to travel long distances, no screens, no entertainment option even if you want to pay for it, postitves that plane is clean.",9,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","On time and not cramped","Departed and arrived on time; Less cramped than other airlines on this route. It is a budget airline, but I would repeat given the correct price and schedule.",9,"2018",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Istanbul to Antalya","The plane was filthy!
There was food on the seats and trash in the seat pockets.
The flight was delayed ...
And the crew are not very professional.
Cheap is cheap ... and trashy.
I have stopped booking with them and my next flight is on Turkish Airlines ... at half the price.
Today, I suggested Pegasus to relatives who are in Antalya (because it is cheap) and they said NEVER - they had a terrible flight with them.
SAD",9,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Don't expect much","What you pay for you get. however there was no delay in the flight and the crew were so friendly. I have to change the date of my flight so and I did not pay any charges. Actually they refunded me as the new date is cheaper than what I booked. Just one last thing. This airline doesn't offer a big legroom. if you are tall better not to book with this airlines",9,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","You get what you pay for! 5 star","Budget airline, cramped and uncomfortable (ok with one of those neck pillows you can buy) but less than half the price of the likes of emirates / etihad.

However they should accept all types of credit card (my Uae one wouldn’t work but luckily I had cash for water!)

They get you on and off the plane speedily. Not sure why people are complaining, you get what you pay for.

Very friendly staff too working with what they are given to provide a great service on a not so great plane.",9,"2018",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","For the Price you pay its fine","it was an ok flight not the best in the world , but during August the tickets price to Doha where mile high. For what It was an ok flight . Again food is sold on request, entertainment is not available on board. I wouldr eccomend to have a bit more professional staff who are more friendly and know how to handle customers , especially that the airline is a bdget airline to the travellers are not the top notch quality. Bathrooms need to be cleaned more frequent",9,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Budget airline","The flight was a short one amd was good enough.The airline itself is a budget airline, meals and water need to be bought and are not offered for free , there is no entertainment system instllled on board.",9,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Didn't like the fact that they needed to do a security check only to those flying to Tel Aviv..","Maybe it has to do with the airport, but when waiting for the boarding they did a security check only to those flying to Tel Aviv.
The flight itself was ok, service not great, food with extra pay but fine to eat..
Overall for a budget airline you get what you pay for.",9,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Flights were on time, nice service","The flight left on time and arrived on time at Istanbul, which was great since we had another flight to catch.
The service was ok, not the best I've seen.
The plane was nice and seats pretty comfortable.",9,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst airline ever","Second and last time to use this airline. THE WORST ever!!! Staff don't pick up phones, its like impossible to get through them and when you do they are so rude. even ground staff at the airport are a nightmare. On top of the bad service, the planes are the worst and always have delays. If I had a choice between taking a Pegasus and cancelling my trip to take another plane, I would..

But service is sooo bad, I would rather pay more than ever use them again!!",9,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Pegasus Airlines review","Last Pegasus flights was delayed for 45 mins due to tire change in Sabiha Airport. There was clearly a miscommunication between captain and ground ops as all pax were delivered to aircraft and then were returned to terminal. After a 30 mins waiting in terminal, tires were changed and we contined to Izmir. As I am in aviation myself, I applause the captain for his flight safety and good preflight check. I rather wait another 30 mins, then fly on a worn out tire. Will fly again Pegasus.",9,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Standard Budget Airline","This is a budget airline like any other, so seats are small and everything from seat selection, hold baggage and food is at added service charges. I have flown with this company many, many times. I often find the evening flights from Stansted London to Istanbul are late/ delayed leaving and almost all flights I have taken with them are full and busy.

The staff are friendly and the planes interior is clean and standard, no issues.

This airline are very reasonable for domestic flights within Turkey and also ticket prices include 15 kg baggage on DOMESTIC flights only, but sadly not on international flights.

Sometimes there are great campaigns/deals on their websites on certain flights and you can get in off-peak periods really cheap tickets for £35 or so from London to Istanbul- you have to keep an eye out for these ones.",9,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Difficult from start to finish","We have flown a few times with Pegasus to Elazig. One thing I have never known them to be on time for any flight. The planes are basic but it is a low cost airline. They have changed their web site but a lot of things do not seem to work. Phoning and asking a question is extremely difficult, they do not seem to understand at all. From London to Elazig you have to change from International to domestic flight at Sabiha Gökçen International Airport Istanbul, the passport control at the airport is horrendous and can take over an hour in the peak season, if you have a connecting flight you have to be rude and push in or you will miss your connecting flight. On some flights Pegasus move your luggage to the connecting flight but sometimes you have to collect it at baggage control and then check in at domestic, we have been luccky so far Pegasus have transferred our luggage for us. I have booked to go again to Elazig, the website has changed many things do not work, links lead to nothing, The manage my booking section on the pegasus website is empty and there does not seem to be anywhere to confirm your passport details (API), on phoning I was informed that I cannot do my API until 72 hours before the flight, but this is not mentioned on the website as far as I can see. There can be extremely long wait times between the connecting flights and it can take hours and several attempts looking at many flights to avoid these long waits that can many hours. It is often better to look for the flights on skyscanner first and then book with the link from there at least skyscanner shows the wait time which on pegasus is not clear. Some staff can be very helpful, but many are completely useless. I spoke to a member of staff and she cut me off, I spoke to another member of staff and they could not seem to work out that when I arrive in Istanbul at 17.45 I would have time to catch the 21.15 flight to Elazig, they said there would not be enough time, they wanted me to wait all night until the following morning at 06.25 to fly, its madness. Be very careful if you book with Pegasus, my advice if you can avoid it you are probably best to do so. Sadly there are not many options for Elazig. At check in there can be very long queues and it takes quite a long time. Be prepared for flight delays.",9,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","SABIHA GOKCEN AIRPORT & PRINCIPAL CARRIER PEGASUS AIRLINES","The Airport is a disaster during peak traffic. I had a Business Flexi ticket but do not expect any privileges or special desk when you buy the more expensive ticket for there are none on the check-in side.
I queued for more than one hour and eventually missed my flight. There are few if any attendants on hand to help and the standard of ENGLISH is very poor. I could not even find an Information Desk?",9,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","The worst","I will start with a broken bag, my bag is made from solid material like a fiberglass, I travelled with it many times with different airlines, but with Pegasus it was broken.
2nd thing, their employees don’t know anything about company rules, I reserved a business flex, so, I have 20 kg check in and 12 kg carry on, but they make a problem for me and asked me to remove 3 kg from my hand bag.
Finally, they are the worst",9,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Pegasus airline DXB-SAW","I am used to travel on big airlines like Emirates and Qatar airlines, Unfortunately Pegasus airline did not impress me at all, although I paid for the seats in front low with more legroom but it was nothing.
It was one of the most uncomfortable flights i have ever experienced.

I would not recommend it to anyone.",9,"2018",3

Absolutely Terrible !!","Terrible is an understatement - they stuffed about 20 passengers seating arrangement and a fight broke out in the cabin because of this ... no cabin crew member speaks English ... baggage collection was a total mess they had us waiting on the wrong carousel ... stay away from this airline .... this is an honest review !!! I was ready to lose my cool - 7.5 hours of absolute torture dealing with this airline !!! Rated a Pegasus a 1/5 —> STAY AWAY !!! Fly Turkish Airlines instead !!",9,"2018",1

"Pegasus-Airlines","Pegasus Airlines","Pegasus Airlines is a low cost company working in EMEA and in Turkey.
The company has its HUB in Sabiha Gokcen airport (Istanbul).
Well connected with the city centre by bus and, in a short future, by metro.
The Company has really low cost tickets and personnel is quite gentle and professional.
They don't disturb You during the flight with marketing issues and the luggage politic is reasonable.",9,"2018",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Not so good","I think Pegasus should review its flight policy. It is very strange for a passenger to buy a water bottle . I recommend that at least they make the water free and include is cost to the ticket price. In all I did not enjoy the flight and the seat was very uncomfortable. In all I hope they improve cause they are a big company .",9,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","not the best airline","we choose this airline because it was the cheapest and its landed at Lyon airport which was our final destination, we pay extra money to choose our seats which I can recommend all of you to do if you want a better space for yourself, I really don't recommended for oldest people or for kids because there is no entertainment screen, or even a radio! and if you like to have a meal or food or drink you should pay for it (in dollars, Euro or Turkish Lira) and credit card but most of times its not works so you will stay hungry if your credit card not work and you don't have cash money, for me I already take with me water and some snakes",9,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Not very good and in particular the luggage put in overhead llockers","Flight from Stansted OK. But return flight from Istanbul there was no control over the size and weight of luggage put in the overhead lockers by the Turkish Travellers which left very little e or no space for the luggage which the remaining passengers had to put in the lockers and these were passengers observing the size and weight laid down by Pegasus Airlines",9,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Big delay","We have fly from Belgrade to Antalya, we have a connection flight at Istanbul, Asian side. Barely find the gate for connecting flight, because there was no flight on big screens, finally got it, and then the delays started, basically we started the trip at 10 in the morning and arrived at Antalya 2 in the morning next day. ( it takes 3 hours of flying)",9,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Good Airline","Have travelled with Pegasus airlines on a few occasions. We have never had any delays, the planes are always clean, airline staff are very polite and helpful.havent eaten on board so can't comment in the food. Good value for money. Would highly recommend Pegasus.",9,"2018",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Prague - SAW Cabin baggage allowance","I have flown with Pegasus multiple times before and very familiar with their limitations. However, the flight from Prague to SAW was far the worst one among all. The cabin baggage I have used multiple times before with Pegasus from DXB-SAW was not accepted due to its size at the boarding gate and they asked me to pay 60 Euro in order to put it in the cargo. My checked in baggage was only 14.7kg and my hand bag was not even 5kg. The ground personnel was so rude and he only decided to penalize me and other two passengers, whereas, many were let go. I'll need a lot of convincing to fly with Pegasus again.",9,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","BEWARE DO NOT BOOK.","WORST AIRLINE EVER. Flight delayed 4 hours and no comment from the staff. Captain never spoke to any of the passengers the entire flight! No one knew what was happening. Not even a glass of water in the heat. Then arrived in London 4 hours late and luggage was lost! Still waiting to hear back but nothing delivered so far. Im not holding my breath but looking at a claim for compensation. When I called their uk number they told me to go away and try calling someone in Turkey. Worst customer service and airline Ive ever travelled with. Pay the extra and go elsewhere.",9,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Good value for money","No problems on the flight. Just little room for legs but it is normal as it is a low cost company, that was ok, as expected.",9,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Bad transfer between terminals","The airline transfer you from Ankara airport international arrival to domestic departure to fly to Istanbul then your can't find your luggage in the domestic arrivals at Istanbul. You can find it after asking so many people in international arrivals that can't be reached because you are simply outside the terminal. After several attempts to allow you enter again you should explain you problem and only one person is allowed to go inside and get the luggage. It will take you more than one hour to figure that out. It is simply a chaos.",9,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","No Air, No Space","I know this is a budget airlines but at least they give the one bottle water to passengers. Also they have a air condition or air condition was a broken.",9,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Nothing is free of charge","You need to pay for anything as soon as you stepped in the aircraft. In this way they are able to profit and fly. You expect, at least on the international flights, something should be served for free. I don’t know if it is cheaper than the other airliners, nevertheless a good choice when you go to the Anatolian, in other words to the Asian side of Istanbul. Leg space is wide enough, I guess, but if someone wide sits by you, you will be in close relation with her or him throughout your flight. The aircrafts look new and well maintained.",9,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Flight to Dubai.","I went out to visit my friend in Dubai. So looked for the best value flight I could find, I couldn’t believe it, £224 return from Gatwick to Dubai.

Would go again with them and would highly recommend this Airline.",9,"2018",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","First time with such airlines...and definitely the last","We booked a round trip to Europe. In bound trip was with Turkish airlines and it was perfect. Outbound flight was with Pegasus Airlines. I believe the airlines operator got mixed up between cheap flights and flying cheap!
We had to wait 40 minutes in line because the system was not working.
International flight of more than four hours with no water to drink...I don't mind not having entertainment system, food. etc...but water!!!are they serious. you need water you need to buy a 300 ml bottle for 2 euros! Such flight could be convenient for a short trip between neighboring countries...but definitely no long ones. Unless you really cannot afford to fly the regular standard airlines...then I guess you need to accept such a service",9,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst airlines ever","The crew is the worst I’ve ever seen in my entire life. Me and my husband travel all the time, at least 4-5 times a year and we’ve used many airlines in the past but this airlines is the worst by far. The crew is rude and inefficient and they don’t speak any English. They offer cheap flight but sometimes it’s not worth it with the way they treat you. FIND ANOTHER AIRLINE.",9,"2018",1

Appalling - arrogant staff who did not seem to care.

Duty of care comes into question?",9,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Poor Flight","We flew from Stansted UK to Ercan Cyprus via Istanbul Turkey, the outbound flight was cramped, but the return flight was one of the most awful flights i have had, the seats were cramped, the air con was non existent and the in flight drinks were a absolute rip off, i can only say that i will never fly with this awful airline again, you can hardly ever move for the trolley services up and down the plane for most of the flight, and the transit through Istanbul is atrocious with the amount of security checks, even in the departure lounge, note to self and others if at all possible do not transit this place.",9,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Bad Ariline","What can i say?
It is a bus that can fly hehe

First, they are deltong too much

The planes were modern, the service superb, and the arrivals on time - and I paid €40 return.

I particularly liked the way the plane staff only allowed a certain number of passengers on board at a time (and on the outward leg called passengers with young children, or with mobility problems, ahead first).",9,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Lost baggage, blatantly rude and horrible service","This is the worst airline to ever travel with! The officers are rude, unhelpful and lie!
I missed my connecting flight to Abu Dhabi and went to the Pegasus stand for help. The stand was empty and after waiting for 3 hours for someone to show up, I had to walk around the airport and outside to the transfer section to find a representative of the airline!!!! I was informed that all upcoming flights were fully booked, I informed the Pegasus officer that I will be booking my connecting flight through another airline To even a different city as I need to be in UAE as soon as possible and figured I had everything dealt with.
To my surprise when I went to confirm on my baggage location, I was informed it would not be transferred with me to UAE on my new flight and I need to book a flight with them for my bag to fly with me after I had already purchased my second flight!!!!
To make it worse, they said I had to check out to claim my baggage (which I cant as I need a visa to enter Turkey) or else it will basically just stay in Turkey!! This is absolutely ridiculous! Telling me that basically my bag is stuck in Istanbul and there is no way for it to be shipped to UAE!

The whole crew of Pegasus were highly unprofessional, unhelpful and blatantly rude!!!!

After multiple talks trying to understand the logic of my bag being stuck in Turkey, one of the Pegasus officers agreed to check out my bag and transfer it to my baggage on my flight. He took a picture of my boarding pass and information and assured me that my bag will be on my flight! I confirmed with him 3 times and he told me not to worry it will be there!

Low and behold, I reach Sharjah airport with no sign of my bag, and they inform me that no baggage has been checked in on my name and that the bag should be in Sabiha Airport still in Turkey!!!!!!!

I have no clue on the whereabouts of my bag!!!!",9,"2018",1

GOCKEN they miracolously foumd 3 tickets for the 2nd morning flight. Name of the totally horrible assistan was Yasmin, avaid her like the plague if you get stuck in Pegasus in Istanbul",8,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","First time experience with Pegasus- much better than expected","I and 3 kids have taken 4 flights with pegasus airline - and to my pleasant surprise I can sincerely say that not only the aircrafts but overall service and experience was good .
It is nothing to be compared with luxurious 5 star airlines- but aircrafts were all new and well maintained ( I am sure maybe older aircrafts are being utilized on other sectors) . Be prepared to have some movies/ magazines or games - also the aircrafts- even airbus- have been designed with minimum comfort- meaning no entertainment/ seats do not recline. Good leg space/ clean aircraft. Staff were pleasant on all sectors- only one thing - they should be trained to assist families with small kids and elderly people. Other than that- happy with the experience and price !",8,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Terrible staff and terrible airline. Never again","Flying back home to Bahrain from London. Faced terrible staff and extremely rude supervisor who wanted to scam me for an extra 40 pounds because my luggage was overweight, which it wasn't according to their rules on their website and on my ticket (8kg cabin plus laptop bag). Plus means in addition to, but instead they weighed my laptop bag and were counting it against my 8kg allowance, quoting ""new rules"". If the ""new rules"" aren't on their website then they have no right to enforce it, how else is a customer supposed to know? I had to throw quite a few things away until my cabin bag was practically empty. The entire time staff was being rude and staring as if they suspected me.

Then they started acting strange about my destination (Bahrain)... If it's a destination the airline offers I don't understand why they have any issues someone is flying there???

Overall terrible airline with horrible staff. Seats uncomfortable, no in flight entertainment etc. I'm a frequent flyer, flown top airlines like Etihad all the way to budget airlines like Ryanair. This was by far the worse one. Don't buy their tickets and hit them where it hurts, their bottom line.",8,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Good for internal flights","A321-200 service with flying time of 1 ¼ hours, leg room and seat comfort much better that previous sector, the plane was also less noisy and cleaner, again no entertainment, and you pay for food and beverages; I would recommend this airline for short services only.",8,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Bad Experience","B737-800 Service, the flight lasted for 3 ½ hours, cramped and uncomfortable seat, and noisy plane; food and beverages at a cost, no entertainment, adding to this low level of cleanliness, and take off/arrival on time; I selected this flight because of timing convenience, otherwise I would pay more and take another airline",8,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Economy Traveling","The flight was average. the seats were to close from each other with minimum leg space. Food and beverage is available for a fee. It is not bad for a 3 hour flight when you are travelling with minimum cost.",8,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Not ideal for long-hail trips","I would not recommend it for flights longer than 2 hours. Char not comfortable, bad in-flight service and care.",8,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Not bad as people are describing","It is low cost airline so the price what I have paid it was very good.
Pro:
1. On time service.
2. Staff were helpful
3. Check in was very easy.
4. Priority for infants.
Cons:
1. Not good for longer people as leg room is not good except first row.
2. No entertainment e.g. TV or music.
3.Free food is just ok
4. I flight paid food was good , u need to pay 13 euro with wine.
5. They don't take care much for baby stroller.
Finally I want to say what u will pay.....same u will get.",8,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Not bad Airlines.","Not bad Airlines. The legroom is good, but the chair is not comfortable unfortunately. If you book with a travel agent be sure from your booking information such as meal bag and seat. The staff is kind. But SAW airport is too messy especially at the arrival.
A big tip: quit Istanbul before 5hours of your flight time. Too much traffic on the bridge to Sabiha Airport.",8,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Cheap and safe","Comfortable and cheap international flight which is hard to find novadays. They were helpful and caring. thanks.",8,"2018",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Fight from hell","They claim the flights are delayed but they are really waiting for another plane to arrive to actually fill the plane up! The flight attendants are rude and snigger as you walk past. They keep you waiting in the departure lounge for what seems hours and when you try to ask what is happening you are dismissed with a wave of the hand! Not recommended at all and such a disappointing start and finish to your holiday! Will never use them again!!",8,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Pegasus airline. Budget airlines","Booked a trip on the budget airlines to turkey and tried Pegasus I think it’s s Turkish based airline. We travelled in peak times so the fares were still pretty high. You get 8kg hand luggage and you can pay for extra luggage in 20kg increments. You can check in online and you can also preorder in flight food via the app. The planes themselves are very similar to the rest of the budget airline fleets. We had a comfortable flight with kids",8,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Delayed flight","Hi everyone! My flight last 15 August was delayed and was upset because I have to take cruise going to Norway! I have 3 hours allowance time but due to delayed flight I had only 1hrs to catch up! Im little bit nervous maybe I cannot manage but i try my best to find the quickest way If you have plan like me think twice before booking",8,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Really poor service","Not only there was a one hour delay without any legible communication from the pilot, the cabin crew also lied to the passengers that the flight is still expected to land on time.
The cabin crew served the food when they noted that the passengers were getting restless (As patronising as it gets). I was offered a drink with my lunch and the flight attendant implied that this is included with the meal, so I asked for a bottle of water. She came back to me over 30 minutes later when we were airborne to ask me for money for the bottle of water that I had just finished drinking. This was very dishonest. overall a terrible experience. It is not going to be worth the money you save. Avoid at all costs.",8,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Budget airline with decent legroom","Delayed and poor customer service. There are no amenities that you do not pay for but this is fine for shorter flights. The seats themselves are quite comfortable.

Unfortunately both flights had a lot of turbulence that seemed to be due to the pilots obsessions with flying at the exact altitude that clouds were forming rather than a little higher or lower.",8,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","barely average airline","i traveled with Pegasus from beirut to istanbul twice , the air hostesses never smile and barely answer to passengers questions , and in the 4 flights the landing wasn't smooth at all... after all it's a LOW COST airline !",8,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Flight no worse than the other low cost airlines.","check in very slow, why does it take so long to process each person when we hold a pre-paid ticket and passport.",8,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Awful service","Pegasus airline
Worst airline ever,
More than 6 hours delay from beirut to antalya and still no answer regarding the actual departure time
Shame on you!!! 😤😤😤
This is my first time with Pegasus and will definitely will be my last",8,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","A total disrespect, no proffesionalism","The flight was canceled. No postponement has been planned, no on-site help, no funding. I bought a ticket with another company because they do not have an office in Tehran. I seek to be reimbursed later. After more than 4 months of exchanges by email, they always discharge their responsibilities. This company is in total disrespect.",8,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Delay","More than 4 hours delay with Pegasus airlines from beirut to Antalya !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This will certainly be my first time and last time i travel with pegasus airlines !!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",8,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","The worst light ever","Had a delay of 1.5 hours , while we all on board.
No aircondition. No water, can not go out of plane 37 degrees out side, dont want to think what was inside the plane. . Hell......
Children are screeming.
Stuff can not help.....

"Pegasus-Airlines","Terrible everything","The worst flight experience ever no leg room, you have got to pay for everything, small plane not suitable for long trips longer than 1 hour, I felt as if I am in sardine can",8,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","I never fly with them","The only good thing in there was the staff. It was a flight with a stop in Turkey, so in total, I had 4 flights from Israel to Turkey and to Czech and then from Czech to Turkey and to Israel, all 4 flights were delayed from half hour to two and a half hours. so it was a very unpleasant experience with this company.",8,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Not worth the money paid","I did not like this airlines as it did not even provide its guests with a glass of free water.
I understand its a budget airlines, but when you are charging the price similar to that of regular airlines then atleast water can be provided for free.",8,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","As expected, Pegasus is usually a cheap airlines if you book early","I did not expect much from the airlines, but it did meet my expectations. The only drawback is the 20 Kg baggage limit, but on the other hand it is easy to add extra baggage if you booked online and it is cheaper than paying at the airport for extra weight.",8,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Airline from hell!!","A week ago my family of 4 flew with Pegasus Airline from Tehran to Istanbul and then to Bodrum.
My daughter booked us over the phone and by mistake gave my nickname instead of the actual name in my Passport . I must add Pegasus only asks “names” to book. No Passport number no nothing else for records!!!
When my daughter asked Pegasus to correct it, they refused. She even sent her birth certificate with my actual name and nickname on it to prove my name. They still refused and were extremely rude and unhelpful to solve the matter. Consequently my ticket had to be cancelled and had to repurchase a new ticket of 300 Euro! I finally faced the problem and dealt with it but I would never ever fly with this Airline again in my life since we had long hours delay and they didn’t give me a flight same time as my family and this was supposed to be a family trip!!
The crew on the plain were very rude and unhelpful, not speaking a word of English. Water was leaking on top of my head in the plane. I complained. The stewardess carelessly said : Go and find yourself an empty seat!!!
I can go on with list of things happened during that flight but I reckon this would give a clear picture for now!!
The worst airline I have ever flown!!!",8,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Better than expected","Efficient check in and punctual - in a good airplane where I did not have anything to complain about.",8,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Good air lines","Every thing was good our flight from Amman to Ankara like any airline but they sell food on the plane with high prices
Next time I will add my meal with the ticket
We return to Amman from antalya airport
Many traveller’s including me examined in the gate of the plane by police without any excuse
They called it teftish I don’t know why
I don’t like this way of dealing with people",8,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Wish they were all this good","We travelled from Istanbul to Dalaman with our four teenage children. Couldn't fault it. On time, good seats (it was only for 60 minute flight) and good service. The plane seemed pretty new and we would definitely do it again. Delivered what it promised at a great price.",8,"2018",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Cancelled flight without informing customers","We booked a flight from Bishkek to Urumqi online sometime in March 2018, which was supposed to depart in June 2018. Pegasus Airline cancelled the flight months before the departure date without giving any notice (no emails) to their passengers, and did not provide a refund at all. We only realised that our flight was cancelled when we were at the airport on that day itself. Extremely unprofessional and unreliable for not even having the courtesy to inform passengers about the cancellation of a flight.

Subsequently, we also talked to their customer service at the counter which was not helpful at all. They even refused to refund us the amount for the cost of the flight. Also, they did not want to help us book the next flight out of Bishkek “because it was not within their capacity to do so” which left us stranded as foreigners. Horrible service, zero empathy for their customers. I would rate them 0 if I could. Book at your own risk if you’re up for a nerve wrecking experience at the airport and have excess cash to donate to this unreliable airline.",8,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Too much was too bad","At Sabiha-Gökcen I had to pay for my luggage but they could not accept either Euro nor card. My card is valid as cash and I've used it on all my trips. The flight itself was not smooth, neither the flight to Antalya a week earlier. There was also problem with payment at the airplane, where I paid cash and had to remind the personnel several times that they still owed me money back.",8,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","This is the worst Airline ever!","This is a cheap airline! Never ever think about it. We were flying with Pegasus from SAW (Istanbul) to FCO (Rome) to YYZ (Toronto). Due to delayed Pegasus we missed our Toronto Flight and got stranded at FCO for 24 hours. Not only they refused to get us hotel but also they refused food, Water. Then they booked us on a cheap flight (air transat) instead of (Alitalia, our original flight). This flight is a cheap flight that you have to pay for everything even the blanket, snacks, drinks. My original flight Alitalia was not this cheap and would provide everything. This is because Airtansat was $1159 vs Alitalia for $3700 on the day we flew! This was due to delayed Pegasus! Never Fly with them! They also lie a lot! A LOT! Our luggages was missed upon on our arrival and airlines passed us to each other! No Airline compensated us for delayed and damaged bag!!!",8,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Reasonable price, average service","If you buy your tickets very early you can find good prices, and it is worth suffering in a narrow seat. Please note that you have pay even for water on board.",8,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst company ever","First of all if you have any other option don't use this cheap company. Last night I booked ticket from pegaairline call center and they couldn't take money from my card then the lady on phone said its okay you have optional booking you can pay in airport (in DXB) so I went to airport at 01:00 Am and flight is at 04:20 as I get confirmation ( PNR number )from call center and all start as like this. When I reach the counter pegasus staff said that they don't have my reservation and as per them they don't even have that kind a system after I showed my confirmation she said that we can not take money and we don't have office here you have to pay online or by call center, then I call pegasus call center again after 35 min over the phone the guy from call center said your cards are not working/ bank is not allowing bla bla. Which by mistake lady on desk said we are overbooked and company sold you ticket but as we don't have seat available they will keep you busy until it's too late which it happens after I heard this I call again call center and the guy said it's too late you can not pay for this flight. I spent my 3 hours in airport because they did not inform from beginnin that they don't have seat for me. I could not fly I spent my night in airport for nothing, if I could give -10 star to this company I would.",8,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Supricing Pegasus airline","The flight was very comfortable and the crew was very nice to me except that all the things cost money even water but it not that expensive..",8,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Getting more bad","I used Pegasus Airlines for both International and Domestic flight, and I know about their average service, but this time it was more bad.
Flight delayed 35 minuets, sitting on board without AC with many complaints from the passengers.
The crew is rude in behavior, they don’t know how to smile. While pushing food trolley, they hit many passenger’s hands without apologizing.",8,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Shame","I really felt ashamed of myself flying with this airline...I have already criticized pegasus airline in their website....This was the first time and the last of course I fly with pegasus during an international flight. National flights I dont mind if it isnt so comfi...but internatinal flights are not so.. Boeing 734 or so was too small. I ,being 170cm,not so tall, couldnt fit my legs...The seats are not ergonomic or anatomic..you cant rest/put your head on the headrest...You have to pay for food and water... During a four hour flight they dont serve water for free. When I question it the hostess told me 'this is a low-budget flight' so you have to pay for everything. I chose pegasus just because it is in the anatolian site and close to my home.. moneywise the cost of the flight was 100tl cheaper than turkish airlines.So I strongly advise Pegasus ceo's take action and improve their situation. I never fly with pegasus for sure...
Binnaz Ay",8,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","No free water on the 3-hour flight","Over the years, I've flown on a number of airlines in various countries, including budget carriers. However, Pegasus Airlines is the first that did not serve complimentary water on a 3-hour flight. They also charged EUR 1.5 for a 250cl bottle of domestic Turkish water, which would cost EUR 0.25 ordinarily. The only reason I gave Pegasus two stars is the check-in clerk was exceptional. However, I'd prefer to have mediocre service and free water on a flight. The fare was not that discounted to warrant charging for water. I will avoid this airline in the future, at least for international flights.",8,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Pegasus Airlines","Use them a lot because I live both in Norway and Egypt.

The good thing has been using flex-ticket. My mother got sick so I had to change the ticket, and it was so easy. No extra charges. Usually they are on time.

What is bad, is that normal visa-cards can't be used on the plane, wish the staff could smile a little more.

Or else it's an ok airline.",8,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","the best low cost","I flew with several company low cost. Unlike others, Pegasus is more friendly with its customers. Flight booking and check-in are much easier and the mobile app helps a lot.",8,"2018",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Super budget airline","If you are looking for a good deal, and a good budget airline, you must try Pegausus.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Unfriendly service","Although ı was at the airport 1, 1/2 hours prior to the flight both check-in countess were loaded with people of approcimately 400.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Outrageous in flight service!!","What a terrible rip off of a business this airline is!.. First of all the temperature in the aircraft was stifling for the whole flight...the cabin crew did nothing about it despite numerous pleas to them to cool it down!...the cabin was grubby and cramped...No in flight announcements at all from the flight deck...so no knowing on expected arrival time etc!!....But by far the worst thing is the refreshments on sale...now I know its always expensive on a flight but these people take it to a whole new level!...Vodka and coke a mere 11 quid!..small can of beer 8 Quid! etc etc etc... disgustingly fleecing their captive audience...and trying to avoid giving us free tap water by claiming they didn't understand what we were asking for....avoid this bunch of clowns at all costs!!",7,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Not Good","Recently took a domestic flight in Turkey and to Athens with Pegasus Airlines. They are a low cost/budget airline, predominantly servicing destinations within Turkey.

The whole experience of booking the flights and processing payment on line was fraught with problems. The website constantly directs you to added services and charges you for what is standard in most other airlines in class.

The inflight customer service is ordinary, and most appear to speak only Turkish.

The seat size is the smallest I’ve come across on this size aero plane.

To be considered only as a last resort.",7,"2018",1

Whenever I see I am flying Pegasus I feel a note of dread in my heart....",7,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Always delays","It has delayed again. My husband and daugter have been waiting in the plane for over an hour and they are still waiting. It was scheduled for 12 oclock and it is 1:40pm now.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst Customer Service and Website!","I still have no even flew with Pegasus but I am very disappointed in their very poor website that has technical issues which seems they are failing to solve. How can an airline have a Manage Your Booking page that does not work. It should be working 24/7. I purchased my tickets to felxible so that I can change them online at my own convenience, but Pegasus has failed to maintain its website. I know that it is an economy airlines but that is no excuse! On the phone they were not able to help me and just told me to use the ‘Write to Us’ section on their website and even that section had a problem as you cannot enter your departure and arrival cities onto it! They told me that their team would get back to me and they might have me purchase a new ticket and later refund my old one. How inconvenient! This was my first time booking with Pegasus and it seems like it will be my last!!",7,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","cozy","cozy flight. apart from people people they were talking 3 hours nonstop about MUMBAI ( their origin country ) and they never put their phones on FLIGHT Mod. those useless people born and bred in UK. i m not racist but really ennoyimg to see that kind of things..

"Pegasus-Airlines","Smooth economy flight fom Berlin to Istanbul SAW","Nice and smooth flight, it would be much better if the leg distance was a bit better but I understand that this is an economy ticket. A funny situation was when I asked for a wine and the stewardess strongly suggested me to buy two because there is a 50% discount for the second bottle.
Well, the second bottle is still in my backpack :-)",7,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst airline ever !!!!!!!!","They forced me to pay a lot of money for some kilos ""in my bag"" when i was behind the gate at Istanbul (transit) not in the check in (brussels)!!!!!!!

"Pegasus-Airlines","Terrible costumer service","After I decided to stay for an extra month in Turkey I wanted to change my flight accordingly. However, the website did not work and gave me the error 'Online transactions are not possible for your ticket' - whatever that might mean. I gave them a call and got to speak to them after at least half an hour in the queue, all they could say was 'my manager is not there, I can't help you' - thank you very much! So now a day before my flight, I still can't change it.. If I wanted I could purchase the ticket with an extra 30 euro service fee, that would not be applicable if I did it online, but guess what? Online still doesn't work..
So my recommendation for you is to never travel Pegasus..",7,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Pegasus offers great Winter flight tickets at discount prices","Pegasus is a budget airline but offers a very good service. Leg room is good even on budget seats. The onboard food is perfectly acceptable. You can get great prices in Winter - look for their promotions",7,"2018",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Departure with a delay","The plane departed with 30 minutes of delay. With Pegasus airlines there is a big difference between outbound an inbound ticket.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Pegasus Airline Flex ticket option is a scam","I booked a Flex package with Pegasus and they claim that it allows you to change your flight without extra charge, I wasn't sure of my travel date (that is a deadly mistake next time If I wasn't sure I won't book), So, what happened is that I tried to change the dates of my trip. But guess what?? their ""Online system"" direct you to choose either the ""departure"" OR the ""return"" flight and when you choose one of those and change the date, what happens is that both journeys get changed to the new date?? thats the departure and the return on the same date. Now when I tried to change the other part of the journey to the date that I wanted thing got little bit complicated. Every single date I choose no matter what is 100$~300$ more expensive than my original payment?? not only that but now even my original date of departure is even 200$ more expensive.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Pegasus experience","The services (before/during/after) flight were greater than I expected, being a budget flight. The only problem I encountered, was the broken luggage!

"Pegasus-Airlines","Awful flight experience","I booked a paid vegetarian meal for my flight to Istanbul from Copenhagen. Everyone on flight was served the meal except for me and I kept waiting for long. Then finally I talked to airhostess about the situation and I realized that she gave my prebooked meal to the person sitting beside me. She started scolding him for her mistake. The next thing was ever more strange. She with the other staff firstly forced me to eat something non-vegetarian. I have been a strict veg since birth. Then they asked me to ORDER something else (paid more money) and then write an email to customer care to reimburse the lost money. I did exactly the same and guess what!! The customer care refused to reimburse me the money making some false claims that I accepted the substitute meal for free.

In general I found the work ethics of both ground and customer care staff to be quite low and decided never to take a Pegasus flight again.",7,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Cheap and Delayed","The flight was delayed, but there was no announcement, no one around to ask about information. Yes, Pegasus is a small airline, but how much does it take to make an annoucement so that passengers know that there is delay?",7,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Cheap flights!","You can prefer this airline if you find cheap tickets as this is the only way you can put up to it.

The seat comfort and cleanliness is ok but it is more like a bus on air so don't expect much!",7,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","I'd rather avoid it","The plane was ok, narrow space for your feet. If you are taller than 1,80 you will struggle sitting down. I flew 4 times with Pegasus, each time they had delays. Last time 2 and a half hours! Both of my luggage were damaged. The fligh attendants barely speak english or german. They are not too friendly and seem unprofessional, are not even able to tell you how long the flight takes.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Too late","The plane was late 30 mins then we got on but didn’t move we waited another hour inside the plane then they apologized and gave us water and a snack , it’s cheap and bad, so if you wanna take another plane you have to book pegasus 5 or 6 hours earlier to avoid missing your coming plane",7,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Nice seating... disappointing food service","Nice business lounge service in Brussels.
Disappointing food business class on board both ways.
Disappointing that Hurghada did not have a lounge bar.
Disappointing that when i asked on the flight back for a blanket after 5 minutes, they seemed to have handed out all on economy class.",7,"2018",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Disappointing!","We arrived in with plenty of time at Dalaman airport, we were flying to Sabiha Gokcen and then an internal transfer to Stansted. There was a slight delay with the plane departing from Dalaman and we had a bout a 20 minutes delay. When we arrived in Sabiha Gokcen with only hand luggage as we had nothing in the hold of the inbound plane, we were told even though we had 50 minutes before the flight departed for Stansted that the boarding gate had closed and we could not get the flight. After a bit of arguing with the desk people (fortunately we had a Turkish Lady who had also been bumped off her flight) We were booked into the ISG airport hotel and given food. They did not admit to the flight being full nor any real apology. Reluctant to fly with them again.",7,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","We are safe now!","Me and my family had round flight from Tirana, Albania to Antalya, Turkey and back. The returning flight on 11 nth of July was a nightmare. We almost crushed during landing in Tirana. The plane almost went out of lane. The instructions were given in Turkish despite the fact that all passengers were Albanians, and only some words in English.",7,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","The planes of Pegasus Airlines are like cans of sardines!","This is a horrid airline with absolutely NO REGARD FOR THE PASSENGER COMFORT! The seats are so narrow. The distance between the rows are a farce. Shame on Pegasus! Sardines have more space in a sardine can!! The photo shows how people are forced to seat!",7,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Really bad - flight delayed and also ruined my suitcase","They broke my new suitcase and dont want to make up for it. really bad company.
Also the flight was 1.5 hour later as planned.",7,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Most awful experience","I have never seen such inefficient staff before even on a low cost carrier.They are useless and have no manners and respect for foreigners.I unfortunately used their service but never again. I got to the airport 2.5hrs before my flight to Athens and after standing in the queue with 3 kids until 45 min before check in closes,i was told by the staff to continue waiting in the ridiculously long queue or get permission from each of the at least 30 people infront of me who didnt speak English,to check in. After i got permission from the supervisor,the check in staff was very disgruntled and then went on to charge me for 5kg extra and did not allow me to remove the weight from my bags. Surely she knew that we were rushing in order to make our flight on time as she was checking us in but she didnt care that we had to still go through immigration and find our gate. I literally ran with my bags and 3 kids to make the flight.I will never travel with them again.",7,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Everything is ok except free breakfast serve!","The breakfast must be free; please!...maybe just a little sandwich with a cup of coffee or tea. Who cares?",7,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Normal flight","Well, Flight was normal, as expected. Everything in time. Staff was nice. You should wait for luxury as it is cheap airline.",7,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Quick, efficient and practical way to travel Istanbul to Brussels","First time flying with Pegasus Airlines, and thus this route. Easy booking process online, good value, check-in time at SAW wasn’t too bad, neither the early morning taxi from Istanbul central to SAW. Passport check was a little slow but all desks open. Plenty of eateries before and after passport. PC290 was a clean relatively new plane, seat was comfy and service was good for a low-cost carrier. Flight was on time, announcements were accurate and sufficient. I bought an inflight meal (not pre-ordered) and really enjoyed it).
My only negative comment was about how difficult it was to pay for the inflight meal. I had two credit cards (not European) and one European edit card - all three were not accepted by their EFTPOS machine - so I had to pay with cash. I saw at least 6 pax in front of me have to forego inflight food because of this EFTPOS issue. Attendant stated that it was cards’ problem not their EFTPOS. Hmmm BS I believe

Anyways, would fly again with Pegasus Airlines, and take a pocket full of Euros and/or Turkish Lira.

It is cheap but service is good unless you need to learn why your fly is delayed: You can not access anyone to get this info, other than that I recommend Pegasus airlines.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Gets you there","Pegasus Airlines is a cheap flight airline, so you shouldn't expect luxury features or even classes other than the economy.

The flight was smooth, the chairs were acceptable for short distance flights, the flight attendants are sometimes rude but most of the times they're nice.

I'll always make it a cheaper option to fly on for travelling to Turkey.",7,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Value for money","Have flown Pegasus few times n am satisfied with the service. I found limited options for in-flight meals. They don't serve free meals n you may carry your own.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Not as Low budget feeling as I anticipated","I was pleasantly surprised with the experience. My worry was that I would be surprised with extra fees at the last minute. That did not happen. The seats were similar to non-budget airlines. Th flight attendants were pretty low key. My purse stayed on the empty seat next to me. I would use them again.",7,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Good time.very good price","Although plane is small with no tv or headphone.ticket price wqs very good.also boarding was on time.

"Pegasus-Airlines","You get what you pay for","Pegasus is an airlines brand professionalized in cheap flights. Accordingly do not expect free sandwiches, beverages or comfy seats with enough space.

"Pegasus-Airlines","A good budget airline","A great budget airline, we changed at Istanbul to Ercan. The plane clean and tidy. The staff were friendly, plenty of room in the extra legroom seats. We did not realise this waa budget airline.
The only thing I would say food needs to be improved but you expect the food to be not restaurant standard.
I would use again.",7,"2018",5

"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst Experience Ever!","Me and my friend were flying from Bodrum to Tehran via Istanbul with Pegasus and had a few hours stop in Istanbul Sabiha Gokcen Airport (SAW). While waiting at the gate a Pegasus staff showed up and shouted there would be one hour delay, we knew Pegasus didn’t offer meal during the flight so we decided to go to a nearby snack bar and eat something before boarding. Half an hour later we returned to the gate and surprisingly found they had already closed the gate and didn’t allow us to get on the plane although the boarding bridge was still in place and we could see some staff getting in and out of the plane which took off 20 minutes later.

- They didn't make any announcements about the time changes or last calls on the Airport speakers
- During our exhausting 8 hour stay at the airport we just struggled to find and communicate to someone who could help or give us some information. Most of the staff, including Pegasus supervisor and Pegasus manager couldn’t (or maybe didn’t want to) speak English properly, we didn’t speak Turkish so it was really hard to communicate
- Most of the staff, including Pegasus supervisor and Pegasus manager weren’t helpful, all they had to say repeatedly was we should pay and buy new tickets for their next day flight
- We had to wait from 12:00am to 3:00am before getting the chance to speak to a Pegasus supervisor, an sleepy arrogant young woman who didn’t have the slightest idea what customer appreciation means
- The plane had took our luggage to Tehran; they literally left us, two transit passengers, without our personal belongings in the middle of the night in a city we didn’t have a place to stay
- There were at least 2 other Pegasus passengers who had missed their flights almost at the same time

I know stories from people who had missed flights with other airlines; although the passengers were responsible for being late, every single one received free tickets for the next flight from the airline at the end.
Luckily, I could find a flight with Turkish Airlines to Tehran the next morning and decided to never again fly with Pegasus or any other cheap airlines; few years ago I had another bad experience with a budget airline, when they charged me 400 Euros for “excessive” luggage while the ticket was only 70 Euros.
It really worths to pay slightly more for your ticket and get it from a solid well-known airline which understands the value of their customers and don’t trap you with their tricks and hidden costs.",7,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Cheap flight","Seats have small legroom. When going from turkey to another country, everything seems very expensive and you don't want to buy anything, but when you are returning to turkey the prices seems not soo high.",7,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Cost","Well, I choose pegasus simply because of the cost & timings. Always gives half the price of a direct flight. Other than that, nothing special. The most annoying part is the seat. it's not comfy at all. Attendants are like robots, food is not very appealing given the high cost.",6,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Low cost is the word","Flew Pegasus from Amman to Ankara and connected with Pegasus to Bodrum and back.
The choice of Pegasus was driven by low cost and schedule of the flights.
If you are looking for a low cost airline, fine. But if basic comfort is important, then this is a dead horse. Seats are not comfortable and space is tight. I say that a holiday is only as good as the comfort of the return trip. To this end, Pegasus made me forgot how great my holiday in Bodrum was and as such I suggest finding a more comfortable flight operator.",6,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Disorganized, always late, not comfortable","Budget airline with huge challenges, online booking sent me to return from Itanbul to Hannover via ANTALYA.
There was a problem with cabin pressure, never experience any ear pains in 40 years of travelling, but did on this flight.
As did many toddlers in the packed plane....
Invariably at least 30-40 minutes delayed, as only one ground staff for boarding available.
A 0.3 l bottl of water costs 3 Euro......",6,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Long Delays, Missing Connecting Flight, Very Bad Customer Relations, Really Awful","My return flight home was a terrible experience. Without any explanation the flight delayed at Paris airport. We waited for 1 hour. Then in İstanbul, it was on purpose to make me and some other clients delay to the connecting flight. Again, no explanation made for causing us to misss the connecting flight. I am sure our places were resold to somebody else. We were taken to stay for a few hours at night to stay at a hotel until 4 am in the morning in the neighbour CITY to İstanbul: İzmit!!!! And taken back to airport . The trip by car to hotel was unnecessarily long.",6,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst airline ever","DONT TRAVEL WITH PEGASUS!!!

This is the worst Airline you can ever find yourself on! They delayed my flight from Lefkoşa to İstanbul and upon arrival at Sabiha Gökçen Airport those headed to Dubai and London were told to stand in one corner and told that our flights would be the following day at the same time. We were then told that we needed to pay for a visa to be enabled to leave the airport and be checked into a hotel. I have to point out at this point that the Pegasus staff is the worst in the world, rude unprofessional unapologetic and don't care about passengers at All! Being a person of African decent I know how racist the Turkish can be and they did it, they never disappoint when it comes to racist antics. The British were told to pay for their visas with cash I was singled out and told to pay via credit card of which I couldn't but had cash on me, which they declined. I sat alone for over 2 hours and then I asked one Pegasus rep what was happening and he walked away to attend to white guests, I asked him if I didn't matter and he just smirked and continued what he was doing. Then one idiot who thinks he has made it in life simply because he works at the airport came and told me that I was going to sleep at the airport. I asked him why and he said ""because you cant pay for visa and it's not our fault and you have to stick to rules and regulations""... One guest who needed to get to his destination before he had visa complications out of frustration said he will never fly with Pegasus and the same idiot said hopefully never, we don't care!
I slept at the airport, cold and with funny smelling sandwiches which they called food.

Don't travel with Pegasus, if you love yourself and your loved ones!",6,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","worst airline company","To be honest, Pegasus is the worst airline company I have ever flown. Customer representative clearly didn't know how to treat passengers, was rude. The service was extremely slow and unpleasant. Was more surprising when on arrival at the airport I had to pay twice for extra luggage, I have paid for extra 20kg on the Pegasus website far before my flight, the amount for extra baggage was taken from my bank account. It was even worse to talk to the staff who clearly didn't want to listen nor talk, and even worse to claim the refund. The flight delayed and the staff was not capable to deal with any requests. I have seen from the plane how the staff thews my baggage while loading the plane. Avoid if possible. Very disappointed.",6,"2018",1

"Pegasus-Airlines","Efficient Transfers","Flying from Stansted to Ercan via Instanbul, flight was delayed leaving Stansted and when we arrived at Instanbul the aircraft parked up and we were bussed back to the terminal, when we arrived there was a member of staff who took us all to one side and quickly passed us through another door and led us to our flight to Cyprus. We had landed when we should have been boarding our next flight and with the Pegasus staff help we made our flight, well done to all staff concerned.",6,"2018",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Cheap, no frills, but reliable","Pegasus basically did the job. It was inexpensive, good arrival and departure times, easy booking, and basically smooth travel. Downside is that you pay for food and drinks, and any baggage or carry on besides your personal item. But even if you pay, it's still cheaper.",6,"2018",4

Its competitive prices keeps overall flight fares low. They are usually on time, which also helps them to achive maximum number of flights in a day! In this rush, the planes are fairly clean and the flight attendants are friendly.

Against these; limited leg distance, lack of free catering, only 15 kg of luggage allowance are the disadvantages.",6,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Good Trip From Beirut to Kasnodar","I traveled by Pegasus a roundt rip from Beirut, Lebanon to Krasnodar, Russia, with a layover in Istanbul.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Absolutely horrible","I don't know where to start? First off, the staff is rude. The planes are old and dirty. The bathrooms on the plane are filthy and have soap stains all over and they look like they have not been cleaned in years. Where we were sitting the trays we're broken on both flights (London - Istanbul - Moscow ) both flights are over three hours long each with a 7 hours connection in Istanbul but not even water is offered.After I used the bathroom on the plane I washed my hands using the dollar store soap they had in there but no paper towels to dry hands. Thr only class available is economy and the seats are really tight with absolutely no leg room so if you are six feet tall and up don't do it. The crew is rude and unprofessional and I am not sure why they are there when no service is being offered.",6,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Below average","We were traveling to cappadocia and pegasus was the only cheap option. For the offering the price was not cheap. Seat are not comfortable at all. Team is nice but anyway you do not interact. We had bad experience with luggage as the locks were broken and suitcases open. Not sure if airline or airport to blame.",6,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Terrible airline #dontflypgs.com","So I had heard that this airline is rubbish by people who had flown but I have them the benefit of the doubt...bad mistake!!!! Delayed going from istanbul to antalya and now delayed again doing the route the other way. I wouldn't fly with Pegasus again if I can help it and I saw a lot of angry people at the airport who had connecting flights,as we did, and the staff wouldn't explain why or give a solution as to what to do to get to our destination.spend abit extra and fly with another airline.",6,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst airlines","This is the worst airline ever not only you have to pay for everything you get, worst service and worst seating, the crew is rude , not even an entertainment tv( i dont mind paying for it but at least have it). This is my first and last trip on it and i dont advise anyone going on it. Pay more and go with other better airlines. Ohh and the worst of all my carry on was 1.5 kgs extra i paid 50 euro for it, I mean other respectful airlines doesnt do that thisnis a rip off!!!!!",6,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","RIP OFF","This flight was booked by the travel agent as it was a better time for the return. Unfortunately they had given me the wrong code to access my booking and it was very last minute before I was able to book seats and check in on line.It was also supposed to be reasonably priced but there was a £20 BOOKING FEE, ON LINE CHECK IN £13 SEAT RESERVATIONS £42 each. There was no bag drop and check in opened 20 minutes late with a 1 hour queue so we were very late for the lounge we had booked. Plane was late taking off but they did make up the time. On board services were very poor, no tarriff available , 3 drinks and a bottle of water £25,needless to say we did not avail ourselves on the second visit.The return flight did have a tarriff and we realised we had been ripped off.",6,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Water for money","The thing which seemed the worst was not the seats which do not recline at all and small legroom, but the absence of free water service for passengers. It felt like absolute lack of care for passengers.
We knew it was a low-coster, but such departure from the accepted standards of service is too much in our opinion.",6,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Budget airline but good service","The plane was fairly new, clean but the seats were really uncomfortable.Our flight was just over four hours and frankly that is the maximum I would agree to travel in this plane.The staff were really good .

"Pegasus-Airlines","Hot & Unpleasant!","The worst flight I have ever been on. It was so uncomfortably hot. I had to ask three times why this was so & was told 'Oh it will be alright in a while' it was for about 10 minutes & then the same thing again! Obviously aircon turned off!!",6,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","You cheat on customers","It was not first time I buy ticket from momondo and choose pegasus cheap flight. It is contained 20 KG luggage for passenger for the price of around 150 euro. But this time I was shocked in chek in that the officer forced me to pay 51 euro for my 20 kg luggage.
The problem rises when you did not email my Ticket I had no Idea about the issue.",6,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Flying with Pegasus was the worst flight EVER!!!!!!.","We had a family trip to Bodrum, in our way back to Lebanon, our flight was delayed and Pegasus agents at the airport wasn't helpful at all, they didn't explain the delays, and they didn't even know how to speak English (even the manager didn't accept to speak to us). which made the communication with Pegasus members harder. After delaying our flight 2 hrs (knowing that we had a connecting flight in Istanbul also with Pegasus) we didn't know if we will be able to catch our next flight (noting that my parents are old enough for them to run in the airport). Arriving on time before the departure of the next flight wasn't enough, Bodrum Pegasus agents didn't confirm our check-in so our tickets weren't accepted by the boarding system and we had too lose our reserved seats in order to make it to the plane. The cherry on the top was with our baggage, it wasn't deported with us in the same plane (it stayed in Istanbul) we had to wait and submit a lost baggage claim at the Lebanese territory. I would like to thank Pegasus agent and management for making a good trip the baddest experience at all. Take advise never ever use Pegasus, since you will never be sure to arrive to your destination and get back to your home sane or even get back at all.",6,"2018",1

"Pegasus-Airlines","delayed and no compensation","I flew with them from Tbilisi to Bucharest, via Istanbul. It was difficult enough that there were 10 hours to loose on Sabiha Gokcen, but the worst thing was that 20 minutes before the initial flight from Istanbul to Bucharest (the initial hour was 16.35) they announced that the flight was delayed 1 hour and 40 minutes. I asked the person at the desk for vouchers to compensate the wait, they said that they are given just when the flight is delayed at least 2 hours. Or course, the plain started moving at 18.45 and we actually took of after 19, so more then two hours and we did not get anything, but a much delayed flight because they are greedy and take more flights that they can handle!",6,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Budget Airline with Budgetted Service","The worst customer service I ever had at the check-in counter at Pegasus Airline in Rome, Italy.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Never again","If you are planning to fly soon with Pegasus Airlines, I advice you to make a reconsideration. I was yesterday flying from Antalya to Ercan. They told me to buy extra for my golf bag. I mean extra baggage allowance of 20kg. This is booked at the airport office of Pegasus Airlines and I flied to Ercan. But at the return flight they asked me again to pay. When I told them I had paid already 20kg baggage allowance, they told me that it is not valid and I have to pay extra for my golf bag. So the baggage allowance of extra bought 20kg could not be used. So they obliged me to buy again extra allowance for my golf bag. This is not correct and they put us in a stupid situation. Further when we have objected at the sales office of Pegasus Airlines they told me they are also fed up as staff due to these kind of bad experiences with the clients. Another point of Pegasus Airlines is that they are always delayed. Their reason and excuse is always that the aircraft comes in late from the previous flight. So if this is the case why you are planning the aircrafts tidy so that there is no space to cover the delayed flights. The worse experience of Pegasus Airlines is the cree members. The best passengers for them are the ones who consume something on board. If you don’t buy anything you they don’t serve you. Pegasus Airlines is a concept copy of Ryanair. But worser then any other airline that I have experience.",6,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","A bloodthirsty airline","We had a 6 hour flight, I woke up having headache, called a flight assistant and asked for water to take Advil with. He told me I had to pay 1,5 Euro for a tiny bottle of water, and I have to have coins bc they don’t have change.
I had some dollars and was looking for them, couldn’t find it. I didn’t expect the airline would charge for a glass of water on a 6 hour flight!!!
The the flight assistant said ok, I’ll bring it to you for free and he left. And I was waiting waiting waiting, then when the headache was unbearable, Iexchaged dollar cents for euro cents from other passenger and went for water. I said can I please have water now: I have euros, I’ll pay, just give it to me!
I guess he felt bad and he gave a glass of water to me for free.
Resuming all this i gotta day THIS IS THE WORST airline ever!
There were kids and old ppl on the plane. How much would you make on this water on a flight 200 euros?!
Shame on you! I fly somewhere every week and I promise I won’t use your airline again and I will post on every social media about this, will tell all my friends, until you change your messed up rules.
Give water to people! Even on African airline they do.",6,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Ok budget airline","No different to flying with Ryanair! Was. Little dubious as had not heard of them but on googling them, found they have very good safety record.

Plane slightly late taking off both ways due to what seemed people faffing about trying to get their luggage into the overhead lockers, however time was made up during the flights and therefore we arrived on time!

Cabin crew were professional. Not much leg room for the taller person.

Online check in was good and you can download the boarding cards to your mobile device.

Would probably use this airline again in the future if flying to turkey.",6,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","overall flight quality was not terrible but worse customer service i've even dealt with","Pegasus was always known for being a cheap airline so not much was expected , but what I got was much worse than what I expected .
First of all I wanted to change my reservation , so I did through the website , but my one of my connection flights were canceled automatically .
I called the international CS number and they told me to make another booking for only the canceled flight and that my trip will stay the same
Then I emailed CS and was told that my reservation was now void AFTER I made the new booking .
So I called the Cyprus CS number , to which a very disgruntled employee answered calling me ""bro"" and telling me to ask my embassy (what?) even though my issue had nothing with the embassy , then when I tried to explain to him what had happened he HUNG UP ON ME and when I tried again there was no answer , So I filed a complaint through email to which I got no response at all they just ignored .
Cue the day of the flight , I arrived 1.5 hours before take off , and the check in was so slow that I ended up running towards the plane because I was late.
We boarded and the staff discovered that the check in employees had put stickers on 3 bags labeling them as carry on when they didn't fit and had to be promptly taken to baggage.
I had an angry old man sitting next to me whom was talking about ""foreigners"" being always late and being ""animals"" and just yelling every few minutes and no one in the cabin crew even attempted to shut him up .
One passenger was ejected from the plane before take off , so the cabin crew conducted a search to identify the owners of every bag in the overhead bins for security , except they missed 7 or 8 bags in a row 2 of which were mine , that's a security risk i'll never take again , never again
So there you have it , value is not bad but god forbid you have to deal with any kind of customer support you will lose your mind",6,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Squeezed up!","Flew with this airline a couple times and have always found the seats to be damn narrow. Paid for seats with extra leg space but this was a bloody scam!! If your row seats are full with no space then good luck to you! Would think twice now before travelling with them again.",6,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","A nightmare!","I had a flight from Dubai to Geneva with a connection at Istanbul airport, Pegasus had delayed my 1st flight what made me miss my 2nd flight from istanbul, there they offered me an accommodation inside the city but I have to purchase my visa fee to enter the country OR to spend 24 hours on the floor in the airport. Since I refused both option, one of the personnel offered me to take the flight going to Marseille, and I accepted as I was going to France anyway. She promised my luggage will be diverted to Marseille with me which did not happen!! I was screwed they ruin two days of my vacation. I was going to the mountain in December without my bag! I spent to days in hell untill I reached my final destination and received my lost luggage.
The personnel... they are horrible, careless, agressive, they shout at customers as if the guests work for them. It was a horrible trip and the worst flight l ever had.",6,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","What a crappy airline!","I never would book Pegasus Airlines deliberately on my own, at this time I didn‘t have a choice. They have old planes, which all of them look like not to be maintained very often. Concerning security of their planes, I don‘t have a good feeling at all! They have Economy class seats only and they are arranged in a very narrow way to each other, so that you almost have no legroom. Food and drinks for a charge only, not even a swallow of water is complimentary. The flight attendants were not unfriendly, but I saw much nicer crew members on other airlines. I never want to fly with them again!",6,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Back to Istanbul","The flight back Istanbul was very comfortable, crew was very friendly and very accommodating. If ever given the opportunity to utilize them again, I will do so!",6,"2018",5

"Pegasus-Airlines","Pegasus is a budget airlines","Pegasus being a budget airline provide satisfactory service. I took a few domestic flights inside Turkey in May 2018 Few things to remember:

1. Their flight schedule faulters - so better be careful to take a connecting flight. Sometimes the delay is almost an hour....!!!

2. Seats are narrow for healthy people.

3. Overhead cabin luggage storage area is a mess - too cramp.

But choose the odd time of the night and get a surprise in ticket price.....:)",6,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Horrible","I have flown around the world and this is the worst airline experience ever!!!!!

We had a 5 hour delay thus missing our connection in Istanbul. Only one flight to Dab within next 24 hours. Pegasus staff were no help at all. They were very rude lazy and clueless. We were stuck.intransit for 24 hours without a change of clothes toiletries etc etc. No compensation given.

Understandlowcost carriers but Pegasus is the worst in terms of customer experience. Never use them -awful",6,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","The worst at all","The worst I have tried at all the first flight delayed 15 hours so I missed the next flight no compenstion no hotel stupid stuff bad crew",6,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Trip to London for Rolling Stones","Flight to Stanstead was fine no problem, coming back to Izmir was a different story, gate number on ticket was wrong, then gate number on information screen was wrong and changed, finally gate was announced but flight was delayed, no mention of any delay, information given was poor. We finally left 75 mins late,after sitting on runway, for nearly an hour. Information given wasn't good enough.",6,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Very happy","Pegasus airline is my airline of choice. I use them, on average, between 8 & 10 times a year
Although it is not spacious it is good value and the cabin crew are generally very helpful. Even if take off is delayed the time is invariably made up in the air.",6,"2018",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","1 hour flight can be tolerated..","Seats are not comfortable and narrow legroom space..Not even reclining. Not ideal for flights over 1 hour. Fly only if you have to..

"Pegasus-Airlines","Pegasus","Left on time and arrived on time. Little crammed but okay for shorter flights. Felt like a professionally run airline with no frills.",6,"2018",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Recent experience tarnished a previously good experience (but would still use them again)","I've had many flights with Pegasus and generally found them to be good. But then that's what you expect from all airlines and a true test quality is when things go wrong.

Booked onto the 00.05 flight out of Stansted; all strapped in and ready to go when ground crew notice a flat tyre. Clearly not a Kwik-Fit type operation so resignation that we'd be stuck a few hours till it was fixed - and hey, better a few hours late than many years early!

From hereon, I'm not sure whether the issues were Pegasus of Stansted...but here goes.

Everybody off the plane and bused back to the terminal (Departure Area). Waited 30 mins for someone to come and tell us what's what.

Then shipped back into Baggage Reclaim. Still no word of what's happening other than there's a technical fault with the plane (I only knew about the tyre because I asked one of the ground crew).

Told to wait by the Pegasus check-in desks. Time is now 2.00am.

At 3.00am, chap from Stansted explains we're not going anywhere and that we will be given rooms at the SAS Raddission next door. Bags will be brought back up if we wish to reclaim them otherwise, they'll be put on the replacement flight - which wasn't known when that would be.

All but a handful decide to head straight for the hotel....who had not been informed that they'd soon be receiving 190 grumpy, tired passengers to check in.

Finally get into bed at around 4.15am

Wake at 8am - still no news on the replacement flight. Head back to terminal and we find that the flight will be 12.30pm.

Not a happy bunny. But as I say, I'm not really sure if all this can be laid at the feet of Pegasus. If it is, they need to establish a more rapid response to what they do with stranded passenger. If it's Stansted, the same applies to them.

I had a similar situation on Austrian Airlines in Vienna last year. Within two hours of it being determined we'd not be going anywhere for the evening, I was sat in an agreeable Vienna hotel supping a beer and then whisked back to the airport in a taxi in the morning.

It is possible.",6,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Dependable budget airline","Our flights were good. The airline boarded on time. We had a problem with rude flight attendants on the flight to Istanbul. The airline failed to request assistance for my mom to deboard the plane. Instead of apologizing, the attendants blamed us as we were walking off of the plane and were rude. It was very upsetting. On the flight back to Tbilisi, we had a good experience from start to finish. No attendant problems, no rudeness. I’ll definitely take Pegasus again as both flights were very smooth and efficient.",6,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Cheap and good.","Cheap no thrills budget company. They get you from A to B. We flew from Istanbul to Cologne. Ticketprice was 50 euros one way. Cheap and simple.",6,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Alternative to UK based Lower Cost Airlines","This is a Turkish airline, majority of passengers are Turkish, the flights commencing in Turkey. For us regularly travelling to Kusadasi it’s now the normal choice, direct flight on a Saturday when we wish to travel, with civilised flight times and great value, always been pretty much on time too.

OK the booking website is Turkish but with English option, but the online check in, via a mobile phone, works both for Stansted and Izmir. The airport there is spacious, not too many facilities but adequate.

The airline cabin crew can appear a bit surly, but very efficient, worth noting any food pre ordered arrives immediately, so unless in the best spot will have to wait for drinks.

Final tip, by registering on their web site, got notification of offer prices about six months before flying this time, at a great price!",6,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Long delayed departure from Sabiha Gohcen, Turkey to Ercan, Cyprus","Me and my wife, we flew from Bucharest - Romania to Ercan - Cyprus, with Turkish airline Pegasus in 05 April 2018. (flights PC 364/PC 1914).
The flights were alright, the crews very good, also the aircrafts.
The only minus was the long waiting on Sabiha Gohcen airport (90 minutes !!!), where we made an intermediate flight stop, on the way to destination (Ercan - the airport in Cyprus).
It was understandable, when we found out that it was about a internal flight line, where it's possible to rebate to international exigencies.
For us, it was very unpleasant, because we arrived in Cyprus at 2.30 a.m.
Return flight (on 12 April 2018) was very good.",6,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Perfectly acceptable - no more no less.","Flight service and experience, was exactly as I would have expected from a budget airline.

I found the online check-in process slightly more complicated than other airlines (particularly for the return flight which was done by mobile phone). This was the only downside and was partially as a result of the default language being turkish.

Staff were pleasent and gave us no issues throughout.

Seat space was limited, but this could be expected for a budget flight.

Both flights left on time, arrived earlier than expected and were clean.

Would use again but would not seek them out as a preference.",6,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Good value for money!","Good airlines and cheap flights. used their services from Tbilisi to Paris and from Amsterdam to Istanbul. Good for short flights",6,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Way back was we want to forget","First we had a flight from Amsterdam to Istanbul and from there Bodrum.
After 6 days back to Istanbul and than to Antalya.
Great flights, exactly on time, and great service.
After 7 days back to Amsterdam.
First to Istanbul we a comfortabel airplane but than to Amsterdam.
Real old plane.
The chairs had no filling at all, you could not sit in a normal position.
It was very hot all the way.
You had the feeling that you could not breath normal.
The staff was great and try there best.
I do not understand why they fly with an old plane for an international destination and on a domestic flight with a much better plane.
But in general we like to fly with Pegasus because they have good service.
And we hope that this was an incident.",6,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Disgraceful","Delays upon delays - 4 excuses given from pilot for 2 hour delay and no food on flight. We were advised to buy food in terminal. Pegasus is now a real no frills airline with non reclining seats and cabin crew not helpful and rude. Never will use this airline again.",5,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Wonderful quick trip","The staff onboard really make you feel welcome form the moment you step on the plane, the food was soo good I didn’t want it to end. This was just a short 45min and don’t have anything really negative to say about them.",5,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","squished and terrible luggage allowance","Flying from this airport in itself was a nightmare. First you have security just at the entrance to the door, so you end up lining up outside before going through security. Then when we get to the counter - surprise - 15kg limit and we had to pay for excess luggage - even though we flew international with a 30kg limit. Luckily it was 8Lire per kilo, so didn't break our bank. Very much a budget airline and as with most budget airlines you get (or rather you don't get) what you paid for.
Then when landing in Istanbul, you need to spend at least 2 hours to get to Attaturk for your connecting flight - my tip, don't do it - spend a little more money, fly into Attaturk on another airline.",5,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","All in all that was quiet nice","Nice airline, which gives great value for money. There is an opportunity to check-in online, so you don't need to stand in very long lines to check-in at the airport! I've travelled from Lviv, Ukraine to Istanbul, Turkey (Sabiha Gokcen airport). There weren't any flight delays, the staff was friendly. However, the cleanliness of the airplane wasn't exellent. It was quiet clean, but I've found a candy wrapper and chewed gum on my table, and spilled coffee or something like this on the seat in front of me. However, the airplane, which flew back to Lviv was much more modern and clean.",5,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Good airline, service is fine and so is the check in.","All in all, the airline is good, flew with them via Istanbul so i had three different airplanes, one of them was very uncomfortable but the others were fine with good place for your feet.
The crew was very good, helping and serving well.
Make your check in online and save lines and time at the airport.
The airline has an app where you can check in and get a boarding code to your mobile without the need to print the ticket on paper.
No food is served during the flight but you can buy food or snacks, pastry and drinks.",5,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Value is very nice","Value is very nice for price. Food is considered good in price however i did not try it to say if it is tasty.",5,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Excellent as ever","I have recently flown with Pegasus airlines and they were completely excellent as ever. Love the fact that I can choose which package of flight I want, extra leg room, food etc. The flight and service was excellent and at a great price. Love that if you book over the internet you can see and choose the different prices to enable you to choose the best price and flight for you. Have used pegasus airlines my times and will continue to do so. Would highly recommend this budget airline",5,"2018",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Cheapest ever","Pegasus is the cheapest airlines for many roughts. Not only the cheapes but very very cheapest! I travelled many times by Pegasus from Bucharest, Beirut, Stuttgart, Stickholm, Erbil and Tehran to Istanbul and always could save a lot of money by that.
Pegasus gives 20% discount on your birthday for pegasus plus members.
There is no in sight services for free anyway which seems to be resinable in comparison to it's prices.",5,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","One of the airlines with the most uncomfortable and most expensive seats","I was on the same airline both ways. The legroom of the seats is so little that a normal size person cannot be comfortable.
While making an online check in you are not allowed to choose a seat (at least an isle or window). The system is programmed to issue you the worst seats available, then you are forced to pay for your selection of seat.

Since it is the one of the only available two airlines serving the destination we have to bear with it.
Looking forward to the third and fourth airline to serve this destination so may be competition will improve the quality of the service.",5,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Cheap- budget friendly- good for short destinations","It is a very good budget airline firm that you can find the tickets at half price compared the others on campaign days. Quality is above average but no luxury. You have to pay for choosing your seat otherwise it is given by automatically and pay for food, luggage etc. When we add up all costs still cheap and suitable.",5,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Good budget airline","It is a good budget airline but you need to have your entertainment with you to enjoy the flight. Everything are on average.",5,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Pleasant flight - when it finally happened","Kayseri airport is neither large nor impressive, despite the number of flights it handles. We were flying in the early evening and it seemed every flight was delayed. Our flight was more than 90 minutes late departing, and there was no explanation or apology offered, either in the terminal or on board. The flight itself was fine, quite comfortable and quite well serviced.",5,"2018",4

"Pegasus-Airlines","No Frills and On Time","Was very hesitant to book Pegasus having read online reviews of horrible service and frequent delays. This was all put to shame - probably one of the best LCC I have ever flown with. Check in at both AUH and SAW was speedy and we were able to bring more than one cabin bag on board both of us. Both out and in bound flights were on time - actually early arrival in both ports.
Seats are as to be expected from an LCC.

Only thing missing was online check in. Would have made the experience a bit smoother but as said, check in at both airports went fast and smooth.",5,"2018",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","NO","I really does not like this airline because the staff is not good. Bagage limit not good. Always delayed so that I have to stress in the transfer.",5,"2018",2

"Pegasus-Airlines","Week in Istanbul","Flying to Istanbul on a bank holiday the plane was and old and very cramped.
Flying back was in a newer plane and the experience could not be faulted on which my review is based. Seats with additional legroom were found for us as we boarded.
.
We used the ISG lounge in Istanbul which I will avoid in the future as it was overcrowded, dirty, lack of food staff and only one toilet",5,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","All your passengers know Turkish?","Flight was delayed on 1 hour, after the boarding, no air conditioning for 20 min, no info from the crew about the reason, all comments which were made were on Turkish only!
It's quite strange for international flight!
Isn't it?",5,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","No frills","As part of a lastminute.com package we travelled out and back from different airports and with different airlines. There was a 20kg baggage allowance and food had to be bought.

But at airport Pegasus staff were very helpful and friendly and made it easy to board. Not all cheaper airlines are so good.",5,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","The Turkish equivalent if EasyJet","Clean, modern aircraft with very good service. We pre-booked seats and hot food from an on-line menu. As it was pre-booked we were served first. Very good quality too. We had to transfer at Istanbul airport and this was a simple and well managed activity with airline staff waiting and directing passengers. Luggage was booked in at Stansted and all way through to Ercan.",5,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Best flight attendants and crew","Pegasus is a budget airline. So keep the expectation low when it comes to comfort onboard. The seats don't recline, space is narrow, no inflight entertainment. So if you are prepared with your Netflix download, just put your headphones and get your own entertainment. The best thing about Pegasus is their cabin crew and check-in desk employees. They are smart, attentive and very friendly. I never had delays with them. In fact I had more delays with Turkish Airlines. I always check them before I plan a flight.",5,"2018",4

"Pegasus-Airlines","Average","I went prepared that it's a budget airline so won't come with much but I was still disappointed. The customer service at the airport was OK, the air hosts were OK too....the seats had terrible leg room even if u compare it to other budget airlines.
On the whole I guess I'd only fly with Pegasus if Im on a very strict budget.",5,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Excellent service","Excellent efficient service and a very comfortable fight. Timings were kept to both there and back. The food could be improved and therefore a 4 and not a 5.",5,"2018",4

"Pegasus-Airlines","Cheap airline, modest service","The trip was OK. The airplane was not in a very clean condition. I always resent Pegasus charging for meals and drinks, but otherwise it was an OK flight. The landing at Schiphol was quite bumpy, I must say.",5,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Don't have much choices","It was just a very short round trip. Everything you want you have to pay for them just like the other airlines around the globe.

"Pegasus-Airlines","They hate Jewish people and especially Jewish Americans don't fly if you are JEWISH.","This was the single most horrifying moment of my life involving world travel. The employee of Pegasus a woman spit on me and told me I would not be flying and tried to detain me in Turkey during a lay over. I was wearing a magen david and was sitting with native Hebrew speakers. A nice Jewish man from turkey tried to get help and he did find a man who did help us and I did end up getting on the flight and when i did the jewish people on the plane stood up and clapped that i got on..announcing...""they hate jews..."" it was so terrifying for me i thought I would be stuck in Turkey....i did nothing and said nothing wrong and was wearing modest clothing but the woman who was working that airline hated me and tried to detain me for no reason...I told Pegasus and they DID NOTHING ABOUT IT. Also while waiting for the flight a turkish woman sat next to me and told me she hates America and she hates Obama and she hates me...it was pretty terrible for a stranger to come up to me and say that...I just smiled and said...well I don't hate you...and i'm sorry you feel that way...wow...don't do it. I mean it really...don't do it stay away from TURKEY and stay away from this evil airline.",5,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Beware of baggage collection halfway","I flew from Abu Dhabi to London Stansted and had a connecting flight through Istanbul. Flight was cheap which was good but only once I had bought the flight did the ticket tell me that I had to collect my hold luggage in Istanbul and recheck it for the flight to London.

The attendant in Abu Dhabi said the desk at Istanbul could help with this so I assumed it wouldn’t be too difficult.

I had a 3 hour layover but then my flight out of Abu Dhabi was delayed so I was rushing once I got to Istanbul to find the flight desk.

Turned out at Istanbul that not only were the flight desk people SUPER UNHELPFUL they told me that I had to go through immigration just to get my bag off the conveyor belt and recheck it on the other side.

So (not having been advised about any visas - I have GB passport so I can get in most places fine) I went to the immigration queue who then told me I had to buy a visa to technically enter Turkey. I tried telling them I REALLY don’t want/need to to come into Turkey I just have to get my bags. They said to take it up with Pegasus flight desk (!)

Cue a trip back to the delightful staff. I told them (again) I just need my bag and having to get a visa was excessive and unnecessary (I already had my next boarding pass) so I suggested could someone just get my bag for me and drop it at the check in? Must be more than just me who needed this? Then I can just go through the transfers queue. This baffled the staff who said that all of this was Abu Dhabi’s fault (because if you’re incompetent blame someone else right?) so back to the visa desk I go (1.5hours until my next flight by this time).

The visa desk queue was huge and there I met people with the same problem who Pegasus also had not advised. Fun part: the visa desk at Istanbul not only does NOT take credit cards, they also only take USD/EUROs.

SO, with time ticking down, I had to: find a cash point, withdraw 100$ (which my Qatari credit cards did not like and rejected me twice meaning I had to use a spare UK one), go back to visa desk and see stroppy Turkish lady, buy a visa (that I don’t want or need), get back in immigration queue, run through to the conveyor belt on the other side to collect my bag, leave the arrival hall (practically running through customs which I’m sure didn’t look great), find the departure hall and recheck in as if I had come in from Turkey. ABSOLUTE JOKE.

Moral of the story is be aware that you will need all of the above if your bags don’t go straight through and leave plenty of time (at least 3 or 4hrs to be safe) as I was so close to missing my flight (and I was a sweaty mess once I reached security at Istanbul!)

Also make sure you can actually “enter” Turkey on your passport, GB is ok but clearly Pegasus have terrible admin and therefore are unlikely to advise if you do/don’t need any kind of advance visa all just to pick up your bag.

RIP to all the bags stuck in Istanbul thanks to this airline.",5,"2018",2

"Pegasus-Airlines","Avoid Pegasus Airlines","After a motorcycle accident in Indonesia and a subsequent 20-hour journey to Istanbul with a stitched wound on my arm, sprained foot and chest, which I informed the check-in agent as well as her supervisor about, I was sent to the sales counter to pay for 1(!) kg of excess baggage worth 8 TL / 2 USD.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Excellent service no issues whats so ever!","My Wife and I flew to Istanbul from London in April 2018, its the second time we have flown on this airline and despite the negative reviews we had no issues, the flights were on time, the plane was clean and the staff were friendly, actually we arrived back in London 25 early!

Ignore the negative feedback, if you want to go Turkey this airline is cheap and will save you money!

Highly recommended.",5,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Great value, efficient, uneventful and as comfortable as you could hope for.","The flight was excellent value for money, all went well and we arrived on time.

"Pegasus-Airlines","do not choose unless you have to","The plane looks like a supermarket , hostesses like cashiers, money everywhere. The sale on board is ridiculous and uncomfortable. You can make people happy with small refreshments. These are not very costly things. Add to the price of the flight, it's over.
Seat ranges are also not very ergonomic. The same applies if there is a difference between the flight abroad and the domestic flight. The positive aspects of Pegasus
; timely departure, friendly staff and relatively cheap prices.
Have a nice flight..",5,"2018",2

2-Service is Zero
3-Even for 2 Kg extra they will make you pay
4-Sabiha Airport to taksim around 2.5 hours
5-In the way back to Abu Dhabi whole way I was praying not die the aircraft bad
in wind and I can hear the sound of aircraft iron almost going to crash
don't follow the cheap rate because this maybe cost your life",5,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","AVOID TRAVELLING WITH THIS AIRLINE...","I returned from holiday on a Pegasus flight from Istanbul to London Stansted on 14 April 2018. My baggage did not arrive. I have spent the last 3.5 weeks trying to get in touch with Pegasus to resolve the issue. It has been a nightmare and I still have no idea where my suitcase is or whether I am ever going to see it again. Pegasus have ignored the various enquiries I have logged (via their website) and the UK call centre say they can't help me as I have to wait for a response to the online contact form. It is bad enough that Pegasus lost my luggage in the first place but it is even worse that they have not even ackowledged my loss (and that it is impossible to get in touch with them). They are not regulated by the Civil Aviation Authority so there is no regulator UK passengers can escalate matters to. EASY ANSWER - DO NOT USE THIS AIRLINE TO TRAVEL. BOOK YOUR FLIGHTS WITH A REPUTABLE, UK OR EU REGULATED AIRLINE.",5,"2018",1

"Pegasus-Airlines","Forced to accept left over food, misbehaved, intentionally lied, blamed me for wanting to video.","The was very tiring for me. I could not eat anything for 6 hours before flight and next meal I was waiting for is from Pegasus.

There were 4 cabin crews on board 2 men and 2 ladies (one of them were miss Tatiana). I bought meal plan online before the flight. I ordered Sea Food but I was served with meat. I requested to give me Sea Food but miss Tatiana said that there were only 1 Sea Food meal. She requested me to accept the steak and offered me to order anything else for free. I am not a fan of steak at all at any time. But since I was terribly hungry I had the meal but I needed either chicken or something else. I tried to order another item but this time a tall man cabin crew asked me to pay. I requested him to talk to miss Tatiana so that he does not charge me. I saw him talking to miss Tatiana. He came back to me after 1 HOUR and said there is 1 sea food left.

My row number was 28. My food was mistakenly served to an old man in row number 26. He also complained that he did not order sea food. So this Mr Tall Cabin Crew went to that old man and took that meal from him then went back to the kitchen on the back side. Everything was happening right in front of me. Then Mr Tall Cabin Crew came to me and said my meal is coming soon. Then I said that I cant accept the meal as I had a doubt that probably I will be given food was already opened and eaten by another person. Mr Tall Cabin Crew requested me to come behind to see something. I went to the kitchen. I showed me a Sea food meal in the storage where foods are kept warm. I requested him to show me the sea food meal which was returned by that old man. Then he started to argue that this is the new meal. I demanded to show me the food which was just returned. But he did not show me the food and talked out of the kitchen. I was feeling very embarrassed since everyone was looking at me. Mr Tall Cabin Crew's behaviour was very aggressive.

Immediately another man cabin crew came to me and said that why I am holding the camera. He confirmed me that it is ILLEGAL to record on board and started to misbehave and left the place. I was feeling threatened and lost my appetite.

I came back to my seat. None ever served me food I paid for.

Can anyone advise what can I do now?

Seating on my kitchen chairs are more comfortable than what I experienced on the flight.

Narrow seats, much reduced leg room, minimal back-rest and seat cushioning, slight move and you have elbowed the person next to you in the rib-cage. There is no button to recline the back-rest. The arm rests were basically two pieces of polished aluminum metal bars.

There was no seat pocket ....end of.

The entire flight was a food shopping adventure with flight attendants pushing food trolley and holding a chip & pin card reader taking orders and serving passengers.

Food quality and price were not justifiable.

Narrow corridor meant every time someone walked I was nudged.",5,"2018",1

"Pegasus-Airlines","One of the worst airlines iv flown","From the start to the end of the trip was a constant worry. First at check in I was 21.2kg and the allowance is 20kg they made me take out .3kg i.e one shirt so that I was 20.9 and then they let me thru. My had luggage was just over 8kg and I was in a constant worry that they would stop me and make me throw stuff out. The whole time u felt they were out there to get me especially after I saw how mean they were to other people and letting them through check in with the hand luggage but then by boarding making them throw things out. The actual flight was a standard cheap airline flight which was pretty much as I expected although the seats were a little bit tight by the legs. I had a second leg with Pegasus as well so my stopover was also a constant worry about my hand luggage. Wouldn't recommend this flight to someone who is going away and doesn't want to worry the whole time from when you start packing till you land whether they are going to stop you because you are .1kg over",4,"2018",2

"Pegasus-Airlines","Long delays outbound and inbound","I had never heard about Pegasus before being booked on a flight with them by my travel agent. It was a non direct flight to Antalya with a stop at Istanbul. On our out bound flight we only boarded half an hour late but we remained seated an hour before take off which means that we had 90 minutes delay. From Istanbul, we took a domestic flight to Antalya and landed at Antalya domestic airport, however, our luggage was sent to Antalya international so when we didn’t see them we had to speak to the airport staff who then took us with many other tourists to Antalya international where our luggage was. It was really distressing as we thought we had lost them and a representative was supposed to be waiting for us but we didn’t know whether he was at the International or domestic and we spent so much time there.
On the return flight we again got stranded at Istanbul. We had to wait 2 additional hours at the gate ( flight had 2 hours delay) and been asked to change gate then called to go back to the initial gate. It was chaos. When we finally got into the plane, at nearly midnight, we’ve been offered a croissant each!! What a joke as if that could make us forget that 2 hours wait at the gate. However, when we arrived to London the delay got reduced by half an hour so we actually had only 90 minutes delay so couldn’t complain and claim compensation. So Pegasus is to avoid if you don’t want spending very long hours waiting for their planes to be ready and if you don’t want to risk losing your luggage.",4,"2018",1

The plane was really stuffy on both journey.. even I had air con it was really uncomfortable, It made me really thirsty. As I didn't have change- I asked if they can use the money they owe me to buy some water. They said ok but they didn't come to me. I had to ask another 2 times.. yet still no water.. at the end I got soo tired as it was a night flight that I fell asleep.. crap service.

Yes it's a budget airline, and no you don't get free food or on-demand movies, same as in any other budget airline. But their aircrafts are siginificantly newer and cleaner than similar airlines (easyjet, ryanair, etc.) and the service is sufficient and comfortable.
I don't get the people complaining about no food service or small leg room. You are paying half the price of any other airline and it's kind of your fault if you did not know what services are offered before you jumped to getting 'the cheap ticket'!",4,"2018",4

Great way -and incredibly cheap- to fly to Israel, Lebanon, Kuwait (and the list goes on) w. or w/o a stop over in Turkey; everything priced as one way tickets so as to allow for all kind of combinations and combining with other carriers (e.g., travel to Middle East from Europe, stop over in Turkey on way back and return to Europe via Ukraine -with stop over- for 350/400 euros). Transfer at Sabiha Gokcen airport is efficient too, check-in at Orly as well. Long bus ride from airport to Istanbul (bus to Taksim) and one reason, still chooses Turkish Airlines if flying on a simpler itinerary.",4,"2018",4

The next flight they allowed a very drunk, biligerant man to stay on the flight. He was sitting next to me and my 6 year old screaming, punching the seat, screaming in my ear saying don't be so ""Fu$&?!! American"" when I called for assistance.

"Pegasus-Airlines","A HUGE no-no","As much as I love Turkish Airlines, their low budget subsidiary company, Pegasus, was the complete opposite and a huge disappointment. No leg room, uncomfortable chairs, no food, flight attendants that were bored (to say the least), no on - board entertainment system.

Both flights were delayed (from London to Istanbul and from Istanbul to Doha). As a result, when we reached Ataturk, we literally had to run inside the airport to be able to reach the gate for the transit flight.
Especially when we had to depart from Istanbul, the airplane was doing circles in the airport for 40 minutes (!!!!!) until it decides that it’s time to take the wheels off the ground.
The final landing was one of the worst in my life, thank God I had tightened up my seatbelt.
We were scared we will not leave the airplane alive, so sorry but it’s a huge no-no for me. Avoid at all costs.",4,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","AVOID","The only positive things I can say about the flight was that the plane took off almost on time and that the crew behaved professionally.

Other than that, the seats were extremely uncomfortable – probably the worst I had ever seen on a budget flight. And the cabin was disgustingly dirty!

Finally for a memorable farewell, I got my luggage with a very long delay (2 hours!!!) with loads of scratches on my hard shell Delseys that had survived a dozen of other flights perfectly intact and scratch free!!!",4,"2018",2

So he will have to do his best to get about on crutches, a real disappointment.

"Pegasus-Airlines","All you can expect from a budget airline","Clean, modern plane and pleasant cabin crew. The flight was late leaving which meant that when we had to change planes at Istanbul (to comply with UK security legislation, I believe. Only relevant on an incoming flight but it is what it is) there was little time before take-off to TRNC. However this was handled efficiently and we were fast-tracked without further delay, as was our hold luggage. The on-board food is adequate, obviously with a slight Turkish bias but that is to be expected. The PA system is barley understandable in English but if you are a regular flyer, you get the gist.",4,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Decent flight- minus the turbulence","The check in was a horrifying experience as they were not sure about the North Cyprus visas that we produced from the embassy. Took us half an hour to clear the issue.No airline staff to manage the situation.Only airport staff at the check in. Absolutely not acceptable especially when we were two families with kids. After that things went well till Istanbul(connecting airport). The flight to Ercan was one of the scariest i have been on in recent times. Too much turbulence and i wondered if the pilot was capable of handling the situation at times. Seats were closely packed like canned sardines.The stewards spoke little English which was OK for us to communicate. They dont have aero bridge at Sabiha Gokan airport and we had to literally walk in the cold chilly morning for a bit. We didnt try their food as we heared it was not up to the mark.",4,"2018",4

"Pegasus-Airlines","A thoroughly budget airline","Arrived without incident. Staff were entirely fine.

If you fly from the UK, e.g. STN to ECN Ercan in North Cyprus, you will need to swop planes in Istanbul. You need to remember a couple of things - Pegasus offered no advice on this as they really needed spelling out. Firstly there may be a one hour time difference between Cyprus and mainland Turkey - this can cause a panic when you arrive to see your next flight is showing as 'last call'. Secondly know that Turkey to N.Cyprus is an International transfer not a domestic transfer. In other words if you arrive in Istanbul look for Transit - International. Don't go through passport control or you'll pay £20 each for the visa to 'enter' Turkey as we discovered.

A further issue was the online check-in and how fickle was the app we used. STN to ECN requires two flights and for two people that meant entering the same info four times. It took a while.

Suggest you take snacks for a longer journey unless you're ok about the on-board prices. (Mind you the airport food on the Turkish side was expensive).",4,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","CHEAPER","Low cost air company, the space between seats are really small, maybe smaller than in ryanair. The airplane was correct it was enough clean, but not specially. Departure was delayed by 1 hour, it seems be normally (pointed in internet reviews).

By carefull if you use it in order to do a transfer to another long distance flight and, take enough time between arrival and new departure.

Crew personnel, were correct with a good english level (not spanish, not deustch) and they tried to help everybody with a big smiled face (that ever is important).",4,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Tight spaces but good as a budget airline","This is an out and out Budget airline. So much so that they have no entertainment system and they'll look to make a buck out of anything they serve you for food so if you're not packing snacks, be ready to shell out about 15 EUR for a good meal.

That being said, it is what one expects a regular budget airline. The seats arent the most comfortable but they atleast managed to put my family together in the same row.

The crew was professional. Smaller planes usually equate to greater turbulence but overall a decent flight experience and the best part is that they are pretty punctual for a Budget air.

I hope they upgrade their fleet though.",4,"2018",3

We stopped in Insatnbul on the way there and on the way back and was delayed both times. Plus the food that was on the plane was definitely not worth the money and when we got back to uk it took us a long time to land because the airport was not prepared for us to land so we had to circle around. I will not like to go on this airline again. I’ll just stick to easyjet.",4,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Horrible. Most basic airline I have ever used","That must have been the most basic flight I have ever used. On the airplane, it was not even possible to adjust the back rest of any seat. Forget about distance to your front seat or anything else normally related to comfort.

Also, it was quite disturbing that for the whole duration of the night flight (3.a.m to 7 a.m.), the light in the cabin was fully illuminated. No way to sleep.",4,"2018",1

"Pegasus-Airlines","The worst airlines I fly with delayed 15 hours no compensation no hotel nothing","My flight was 16th Mar 2018 at 4:15 AM the flight delayed 15 houres due to no crew it is funny reason there was no represintative or office to complain.
They dropped us in the airport along with children for long time also I lost another flight due to the delay.
Once I arrived Istanbul the Pegasus delegate was very rude he said no compensation no rebooking no hotel you must manage by your self.
I booked hotel by 100 eouro then I booked new ticket by 650 eouro to my destination.
DONOT FLY WITH PEGASUS THE WORST AIRLINES IN THE WORLD.",4,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Price vs Comfort","Price was very affordable compared to other airlines companies. However, the comfort and the space are a little missing. Then, you got the option of no-food ticket which is good for short trips, but for longer ones and with kids you need something to bite, thus food on Pegasus is everything but food.",4,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Good when you're looking for less cost","It's my second time to fly to Europe with Pegasus airlines and maybe not the last.
Moderate airlines with average service but one of the best options when you're looking to save some money for your trip.
I always go for advantage tickets for its baggage allowance and seat selection.
Their sandwiches not that good so it's better to eat before your flight.",3,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","worst airline ever ...","15 hours delays and no apologises from stuff. very rude, call centre is rubbish .never again. you better of stay away from them",3,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","the Worst flight I have ever been","My language was a bit overweight. I paid the overweight fee, however; I did not get back the change. The checking guy told me that I can receive in the airplane but when I mention to the lady who is working there. She said I have no money and I can’t help. I called customers service and explained the situation no one were able to help.

It is cheap flight but rather pay a bit more than get tricked and bad service.
Stay away from this flight",3,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","basically what you would expect from a budget trip","not much to say really, basically what you would expect from a budget trip, nothing less nothing more, seats was not bad actually. Did not take credit card on board since they were ""not online"" ...whatever that means ;)",3,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","An Average Quality...","A classical Pegasus flight not to be compared with the other airlines. Really good prices but everything is extra charged which is normal and why you get cheap ticket prices but the service could be better.For example some basic drinks can be offered free during the flight such as water or coffee.",3,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Normal","The price was good
Seats not comfortable
Food and drinks too expensive
They don’t give you a water if you don’t have euro’s in your paket,it’s too bad",3,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Atrocious customer service","My wife and I flew from Istanbul to Hatay with one bag. It was a backpack just slightly too large for carry-on. They lost it. Only one person is working in the Hatay airport and she didn't process our claim properly. Be prepared to scream at Pegasus on the phone Many times-apparently this is the only way to get them to do their jobs. Now we are shopping for necessities instead of sightseeing on holiday. Turkish Air charges a little more than Pegasus, but it is worth every extra kuruş!",3,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Only if you don't care when and where you will land","Both flights (from Cologne to Istanbul, from Istanbul to Abu Dhabi) were late but that wasn't the worst, since the airline seems to be famous for this. When the plane tried to land in Abu Dhabi it stayed in the air, for a long time. After a while came the information that we couldn't land in Abu Dhabi due to the weather conditions. Instead we flew to Sharja - about 200 kilometeres away. When we landed in Sharja no-one was on the landing field, apparently no-one knew we were there. We had to wait again. After a while the pilot told us that we had to wait some more but inside the airport of Sharja, but that this would only be possible after a couple of hours. Indeed after a couple of hours we were transported to the airport terminal, where we waited again without information, an apology or even a complementary glass of water. After hours the airport personal told us the the airplane took off - luckily without our luggage. The shift of the crew was over so they just left us there. After a while we were told that we had to organize our transport to Abu Dhabi ourselves because no-one knew if a new airplane from Pegasus airline would ever arrive.
The airline wrote me today that they would not cover my taxi fare (of 80 Euros) because I should have taken the public transport service. I am not a native speaker of Arabic, was not familiar with Sharja or the public transport system and taxi fares in Abu Dhabi are cheap - but still they wont cover my expanses. I was over 9 hours late, had to pay more and was at the wrong destination. How much more can you mess up?",3,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Holiday trip","Due to the restrictions applied to airlines flying from the UK to Sharm El Sheik we used Pegasus to get us there flying via Istanbul. Pegasus is a budget airline so there is a no thrills aspect to their service. However, check in at Stansted was professional and efficient. Although we decided against the online option of pre-purchasing our seats, the three of us were seated together on both the outward and return flights. All our flights departed and arrived on time. The first leg to Istanbul was full and very cramped. I am 5’ 10” tall and found the leg room on offer slightly uncomfortable. The 2nd leg, from Istanbul to Sharm el Sheik, was much more comfortable as it was a newer Airbus A320 with the newer generation of seating which allows more leg room. The return flights were much better as both fights were not full so there was plenty of room to spread out. Food and beverages were on offer at regular intervals and the price seemed to be not too excessive. The aircrew on all our flights were professional and friendly. The only minor quibble we had was that due to this being a Turkish airline the inflight announcements were made in both Turkish and English and as English is their second language some of the pilots announcements were hard to understand, partly due to the poor quality of the P.A. System.",3,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Low cost airlines, I would say average. Flight were ok, with a half an hour delay.","It was ok, with a slight delay. Seats were quite narrow, but for a short distance its ok. We have not received water during the trip. Staff ok.",3,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","worst airlines","i had a flight with my friends on this terrible airlines we were 3, after checking in and getting to the boarding, a very rude staff started yelling at us and treated us like if we were terrorists first we didn't knew what it is about at the end it was because we had few extra kilos, when we tried to explain that's its the loukoum and chocolate , perfume... we got from the duty free he refused to listen because i don't have the receipt, i told him i can just through them away and i am not holding enough money, he just refused and started to threaten us if i don't pay the extra kilos we will miss the flight he was not respectful , he just wanted MONEY.
they are not even close to meet the standard of customer service.

"Pegasus-Airlines",":(","Some staff lack the minimum standards of interpersonal and communication skills. They don’t meet standards of customer service.
During boarding staff were very rude. The handbag was slightly overweight due to duty free purchases( even-though at check in it was marked as 8kgs)We tried to explain to the man “M”, but he even refused to see what is in the bags. He said you have 30 seconds to pay and get on the plane (since we were the last in the boarding line). He actually threatened us to miss the flight if we don’t pay him within 30 seconds.My friend tried to remove the Turkish delights and some other stuff from the bag! He stopped her and said you don’t have time now pay,you have 30 seconds. And refused by all means to listen.

The only downside to Pegasus is that they DONT do onboard duty free",3,"2018",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","A few criticism","I have generally a positive view of Pegasus Airlines. However, in my last two flights, I was very annoyed with the speed of the service. At planes of this size, service starts from both directions. You have at least 28-33 rows on this plane. However, the service starts from the front and it takes a very very long time to come to the end of the plane. Also the drinks and the snacks service is not synchronised. You get one thing and wait for the other very long. They should have sufficient staff to start the service from both directions. And since the company started, stewards always run out of cash and return your change later. In some cases this may easily be forgotten. So this needs to be addressed seriously. This is not once or twice, but many times. Otherwise, the flights are good and not like other lower cost airlines. It should improve itself in these fronts and be better at competition!",3,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","You have to pay even for a glass of water.","The airline advertises as a cheap airline. They are at the climax of opportunism. When the demand goes up the ticket prices skyrocket and exceeds the business class prices of other airlines.
There is no inflight service. But everything is available if you pay extra.

The volume of the speakers is so high that when they make announcements I had to cover my ears.

The legroom!!!! For the sake of a couple more rows they squeeze the passengers so uncomfortably that you feel like making yoga while sitting.",3,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","If you loose something on a Pegasus plane - you are lost","I forgot my iPad in the airplane on the flight from TEl Aviv to Istanbul
I continued fro there to Frankfurt
Only the day after my arrival I realized the loss
At the beginning I had no idea what had happened
The Pegasus office in Frankfurt was very helpful. They found out that I had forgotten the iPad on my first leg and that it was found and even got a tracking nunumber.
They referred me to the ISTANBUL office
And there the nightmare started
I was referred to the PEGASUS website and paid first of all 30 Euros and filled out a form and gave all the details
And then nothing happened.
It was impossible to resch them by phone. All the recorded messages were in Turkish
Only the head of the Tel Aviv office, Mr Avi BARUCH saved the day
He was both nice and efficient
And within a few days I got my iPad back.
But the Pegasus office in Istanbul is horrible.",3,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","LOST BAGGAGE AND CONNECTION PROBLEM","We travelled with Pegasus on Saturday, March 17th from Istanbul. Upon arrival in Amsterdam, we found out that their agent at check-in in Istanbul never checked us in to our connecting flights, even though we repeatedly mentioned that our final destination was Toronto and we ensured that our bags would be there too. The agent showed us the tags on the bags and reassured us. Not only were we on standby in Amsterdam, due to his ineptitude, but when we finally arrived in Toronto one of our bags had not arrived. We spoke with the connecting flight airline that we used, KLM, and they confirmed that this agent from Pegasus never even put the bag in the system in Istanbul. How can something like this happen? No connecting flight? One bag arrives but not the other? Then when I contact Pegasus the employee says that it is not their responsibility, it falls on the final destination's airline. Where is the apology or the assistance on your part?",3,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Early Morning Flight to İzmir","I flew to izmir for business purposes.

"Pegasus-Airlines","good for budget, not comfort","Since the prices were really low for the dates we bought the tickets for, I kinda accept the service I get from the airline. However, there are times when the prices are not that low compared to other airlines where you get food and beverages for free, have in-flight entertainment and better leg space and seat comfort. At that time, it is for sure that I don't prefer Pegasus airlines. I wish at least they could offer 1 bottle of water for the international flights. It is funny to ask for 1,5 euros (8 liras) for a 330 ml bottled water (not even 500 ml!!). This is kinda ridiculous to me. Hope they change it one day. The seats are not comfortable and the leg space is so narrow. If the person in front of you decides to put his seat down and sleep, your flight can become a nightmare, good luck.",3,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Budget flight","value for money is ok less food, entertainment on board, food, baggage allowance and not able to select seat for online check in. So basically, if you want to avail above then you have to pay for the extras. Anyhow, for budget traveler less expectations.",3,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst experience so far","We were flying as family with two kids from Vienna to Dubai via Istanbul and then back. Out of four legs of flights, four of them were delayed (100% success). Delays were not announced by staff, no explanation, no apologies....in Istanbul there was no staff to even ask for any information about delays. They just don not care. No food is included in ticket, so you have to pay for everything even water. Seat are very uncomfortable, not enough leg room for taller people, no in-flight entertainment whatsoever...so 4 hours flight was pain. Their staff couldn't care less....there were two people standing in the aisle while we were landing in Vienna, opening overhead lockers while taxi, but no one said a word to them. At home we realized that one of our suitcases was damaged (punctured). It was our worst experience, we will never fly Pegasus again.",3,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","You have to pay for everything","We (together with my sister) arrived at the checkin counter 1hour and 10 minutes prior the departure of the plane which is an acceptable time.
But due to the slow checkin procedure and payment requests of overweight issues we waited more than 30 minutes to reach the desk. Because Pegasus airlines has started a new timing for checkin, which is finishing checkin 40 minutes before departer, we faced a problem with our flight. The responsible supervisor has than solved hopefully our problem.
1- This 40 miutes is not an acceptable value.
2- Pegasus Airlines should sometimes keep an eye closed for minor overweight issues.
3- The checking desk employees should be faster",3,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Very weak services","The flight was not good. The airplane was Airbus a320. It was not comfortable at all. There wasn't enough space for my legs. They sell everything even water. You have to buy everything. The flight had 4 hours stop in Istanbul between flights. It was very boring. A man during flight had something like heart attack but the crews didn't know anything and ask passengers to help him. Fortunately he was ok. The crews we're nice.",3,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Not as low cost","Considered to be a low costs airline, and the prices are rather expensive, even if booking in advance. The seats are quite uncomfortable, and most of the other low budget airlines are much more comfortable. Has problems with the baggage as their carry on size is smaller than average. Overall, may be a bit cheaper, but not worth it.",3,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Walk, if you can","Look. If you have any chance of rather walking, do that instead. I travel approx. 200 days out of the year and fly over 100 flights a year and have done over the last 10 years. But this flight far exceeded any horrorstory I had logged up to this flight. The plane was clean, the staff was helpful but I would rather like to have more than a 2 1/2 inch clearance between the edge of my seat and the back of next one.
By far the most cramped and uncomfortable flight I have ever had the misfortune of doing.
And this is par for course. This is actually my 4th flight with this airline. Same story every time.",3,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Great Flight","My flight from Istanbul Sabiha to Berlin was great. Crew was helpful. The only thing I do not like is you pay for all food and drinks. You pay for all. Accordingly flight rate is reasonable compared to other airlines. We will fly again...",3,"2018",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Good","There are bad reviews about this airline, and we were nervous before flying with them for the first time, but we found that the staff was helpful. And we used this airline 7 times more. The plane was modern almost and clean. They are at least as good as an economy airline and we did not have any complaints about them at all.",3,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Low budget airline","we booked ticket from Pegasus airline since we're on tight budget so we ended in Pegasus , it was long layover in the history of my life tho 15 hours transit to stay in the airport without internet , staff of Pegasus most of them don't know how to speak English and even they're not approachable . Airline is quite dirty , flight attendants is not well groomed , they don't seem to smile often . anyway this will be my last to book this airline",3,"2018",3

"Pegasus-Airlines","Review based on pre-flight experience...may change after the trip","My pre-flight experience has NOT been good. Booked online through KLM from JFK-SAW, connection in Amsterdam. No notice that Pegasus is a ""low cost"" airline, extra for choosing a seat, extra for bags, and--worst of all--can't check my bag through from JFk-SAW. I have to pick up the bag in Amsterdam and go back through security, and then check-in to Pegasus. Tried to call and choose a seat:

Pegasus: ""Sorry, since you booked through KLM, you will have to choose a seat through them.""

KLM: ""The Pegasus seat map is not available to us. You will have to wait till you get to Amsterdam and check in [after picking up my luggage and going back through security] with Pegasus for your flight to SAW.""

New call to Pegasus (same number as first call): ""Sorry, no one here speaks English.""

I think this might have been made clearer to me when I booked. I absolutely would have gone to IST instead.",3,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Low cost flight","Expect a long queue for checking in ( 1 hour). Sabiha Gökçen is not the best airport either, so make sure you arrive at least 2,5 hours before. Pegasus is a low cost company and you should not expect much. You can buy sandwiches, snacks, water on the plane. OK for upto 4 hours flights. Would not recommend for business trip.",3,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Average airlines","Pegasus is a budget airline and yeah it is good for frequent travelers. But please remember that even drinking water is charged in the airlines. This is the only disappointing factor but otherwise, everything is good in the airlines.",3,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Low-cost company with solid service","When people hear ""low-cost company"" they can be skeptic. My first time with Pegasus Airlines was in January this year, and it was from Belgrade to Istanbul. Only thing that I didn't like was waiting a bit longer to board the plane, on my way to Istanbul. Not sure if it was company's fault. But as for everything else, I was satisfied. From mistake that I made on my reservation (luggage and meal on the wrong flight) where they fixed everything in less than a day after I asked by email, to help with my seat in both ways. Workers at the counters were polite and helpful with every question. Meal that I payed for in advance was good. I would use services of FLYPGS again",3,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Beware of cancelled holiday flights","Booked a holiday through Cyprus Paradise but for personal reasons needed to change the dates. Hotel was no problem but Pegasus wanted to charge us the plane fares again i.e. £461 plus £98 to re allocate our seats. So effectively charging us twice. The holiday was for May 5th so plenty of advance warning. So we cancelled the whole thing and have just paid £461 plus £98 plus £98 to Cyprus Paradise! Be aware Pegasus do not refund or amend bookings. Seems a sharp practice to me as l am sure our twice paid seats will not remain empty on the flights.",3,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Clean and Comfortable","Before my travel experience, my friends had spoken few negative comments about this airline. However my experience was totally opposite of what they had said. The planes were clean, comfortable and most importantly the flights were punctual.
Yes its not what we call the first class or the better economy class travel that we all percieve but lets be honest here. We all are looking to save a penny when we look up this airline under the budget airlines category. And this one is defenitely recommended!!!!!!",3,"2018",4

"Pegasus-Airlines","Low budget flight","Horrible Security staf at airport, they are working at airport , and couldn’t talk English. At boarding time I had really bad experience. I was traveling from Dubai to Copenhagen via Istanbul. At Dubai Airport I had declared 1 handbag and 1 Shisha Shape box. Security at Dubai airport boarding for Pegasus had cleared me to travel. I Landed in Istanbul, when I was boarding again to next flight, they charge for extra weight.. Now they say I had to pay for extra baggage, cause now I had 2 hand carry, I tryied to convenes him that I was coming from Dubai, and didn’t enter from Istanbul. But he insisted that I had overweight and had to 184 usd, for extra bag. Normally when u get transit flight, u don´t need to weight your luggage again.",2,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","My first and last experience with this 0-star airline","Our reserved seats were occupied by a family. We asked them to relocate to their assigned seats, and they refused. We asked cabin crew who was terrible in English and very rude to help us with this situation and she forced us to sit in another place! Seats were too tight, there was no head or neck rest on the seat was more like a grave rather than a seat. The cabin was too dirty and smelled tribble. You should buy the meal or drink, which were insanely expensive! The flight could be easily rated as a zero-star flight!",2,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Functional, but crumpy","Pegasus is a low-cost airline and everything about low-cost is true about them.
Very functional, almost punctual, but no service whatsoever.

The biggest issue was the fact that we were flying as a party of three on two different PNR numbers, because of travel agency error and it was impossible to sit together. This due to the fact that the seat allocation is performed ONLY by PNR and you cannot change without paying extra.

The rest was OK, although I would really suggest to buy a luggage+seat package from them.

The Pegasus hub in Istanbul was actually much better that could be expected from low-cost hub, with good selection of eating choices. However there were no place to sit for 4 hours lay-over.",2,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","First and final experience with Pegasus Airlines","Didn't know what I was getting into, but the Expedia offer of a good connection to Izmir and seven nights' stay at the Renaissance, a five star, was tempting. Now regret I didn't read the reviews! This is okay for one-hour trips. Full stop. The seats are tight, narrow and the on flight food and beverages are overpriced for the service if any. It is a never again experience for my wife and myself. As world travelers ourselves, Pegasus can easily claim to be the worst airlines in our experience.",2,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Pegasus Airlines Transit Desk (Arrival Section) at Sabiha Gokcen Istanbul airport","We are a couple who got stranded at Sabiha Gokcen Istanbul airport due to visa issues. I am writing this review to merely commend the assistance offered by Pegasus Airlines Transit Desk (Arrival Section) at Sabiha Gokcen Istanbul airport. Customer service reps must learn from them to deal with their paxs. I am sorry that I couldn't get their names. On that desk, there was a man with specks. He spoke with great professionalism. Even his colleague, the tall young lady with cute pony tail. Though, being a rush hour, they showed the patience to listen to us attentively & provide alternatives to our problem in hand. Kudos, keep up de gud work!",2,"2018",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst Service Ever","When we got to the Airport in Cyprus we gave all our flight details to the people at the desk and asked at the if they could book us through to our connecting flight with Qatar Airways, after a quick mumble to his colleague all we got was see our desk in Istanbul and they will sort it for us.
We boarded the short flight and as it was early morning we had booked a sandwich each but as you have guessed no sandwich.
We got Istanbul and went to the Pegasus Desk and explained what we were told when we checked in, the lady there did not want to know anything she told us we had to collect our luggage and check in with Qatar ourselves, this meant we had to get a visa(cost 20 pounds per person) to go through passport control to get our bags instead of just going through international transfers despite several people from Turkish Airlines having a word with her she would do nothing.
So we had the extra expense of a visa each, The Lady (I am being polite and biting my tongue over this description of the person) was rude short tempered and bombastic in her attitude and is in the wrong job dealing with members of the public.
On the Return Journey things could not be more different we gave all our details to Qatar Airways and they sorted everything we never saw our luggage again until we got back to Cyprus.
In short I will never use Pegasus Airlines again",2,"2018",1

It's only one hour or so.
The rates are good, and cheaper than the other options anyway.",2,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Never again","Unfortunately I never got off the ground. I was denied boarding at Fiumicino because my identity card had a slight tear in the side. Apparently Turkey only accepts perfectly fresh documents AND if you are travelling on a national passport, they apply the six month clause i.e. your must be valid for 6 months after the dates of your travel. At the same time, other travellers were turned back for the same reason although their identity cards were only slightly damaged but ""damaged"" is the word that describes what is unacceptable to them. Pegasus Air should spell out these provisos to travellers to avoid what happened to me and others at the last moment at the airport when it is too late to rectify the problem. In fact, there is an office in the airport which issues new identity cards but only after consultation with your Municipality of Origin. I was travelling on 30 December so the first opportunity to get a new document was 2 January. I duly bought a second ticket for 2 January only to discover at arrival at the airport that the ""anagrafe"" in the Municipality of my home town was closed for repairs.
My complaint is: a. that Pegasus should spell out the requirements for undamaged documents and b. that the Pegasus personnel in Fiumicino should be more sympathetic and understanding when turning away disappointed and frustrated travellers.",2,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Never ever fly Pegasus","Both of my flights were delayed. One hour. And 3 hours 40 minutes the next one from Istanbul to Bishkek.
Crew announced we don't land in Bishkek due to bad weather conditions. So we landed in Almaty instead, which is a) a different country, so many passengers had a huge trouble dealing Kazakh customs b) 250 km away from the original destination.
Nobody from the company took a trouble to tell 200 people when the flight to Bishkek will take place. 200 people with little kids were trapped in transit zone for hours and hours not knowing what are they waiting for and for how long. Many people came from different countries and had no local money, no access to internet. Many had small kids and no assistance was provided to them either. For 3 hours nobody bothered to do anything about 200 people without possibility to buy water or food, find place to rest after 9 hours of night travel (4 hours delay in Istanbul airport and 5 hours flying). Until these people started calling for airport representatives. Which gave us a choice to wait 12 more hours in the transit area for the Pegasus crew to rest at the hotel and bring them to a place they were supposed to bring 20 hours earlier. Or take a bus to Bishkek, covering all transportation cost themselves.
I managed to leave the airport with great difficulties and organize myself a transport back home. So, I can't say what happened after I left that nightmare but I honestly don't think anything was done for people who weren't able or couldn't do that.
And that still was no action on behalf of anyone from Pegasus. All was done by the Almaty airport stuff after long discussion with some of the passengers.
To sum it up - if you use this airline, be ready to meet absolute ignorance, incompetence and completely careless attitude you as a customer. Be ready to solve all problems appearing yourself, and don't expect any refund for the expenses.
I don't think the company will care about this feedback. But I think it's important for people to know and avoid booking anything with Pegasus for the sake of a comfortable travel and humanlike attitude.",2,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","One of the worst flight in the world!","I had 4 flights this time by Pegasus. Seats were very ""Uncomfortable"" with very-very close fitting leg room. You can buy coffee, drinks or sandwich in an expensive price.
Most flights in Istanbul are from Sabiha airport.
It will be very bad experience, if your flights are over 3 hours length, especially if you have a connection flight.
Related to the Turkish airline, it is cheaper (about 20%), but this does not cost you, because you will be tired and will actually lose your first day of the trip.
The only positive things were helpful staffs and good landing.",2,"2018",2

"Pegasus-Airlines","Cyprus Winter Break","I read and heard some mixed reviews about Pegasus and began the trip with a mixture of neutral feelings and trepidation before the flight. With rules on flying directly into North Cyprus being what they are a change of plane is required at Istanbul. All I can say is the flight attendants were courteous and efficient the flight was smooth and on time and the transfer went as well as security checks will slow. One tip at Istanbul, go via International Transfers ( it’s easier) as far our party were concerned the flight was as good as any budget airline and better than some. One thing we found peculiar, the in-flight menu was in Euros, we paid in Stirling and we got Lira as change! Such fun. Well done Pegasus we will fly with you again.",2,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worse Airline in the WORLD!","This was probably the worse journey of my life.
We arrived at the airport - the queues were horrendous. We waited over 2 hours in the ""Online check in - Baggage drop off"" queue.
Customers were missing their flights, skipping the queues. No warnings given when the flight gate closes.
After 2 hour wait in the queues, arrived at the gate, delays as usual no surprise.
On the plane we ordered food, 2 meals costing us around £25.
Everyone on the flight received their meal we only received one of our meals.
We waited and spoke to the attendant who said it will arrive soon.
Half an hour later, everyone has eaten no food has arrived. Attendant was called and we were told the food had dropped so they had to cook a new one.
WE waited another 45 minutes for the food to be ""cooked"" in the oven. The food came frozen. After complaining to the head of the cabin crew, we were told;

""As a goodwill gesture we will heat your food and give you your food in 20 minutes seeing as you have already paid and it will look bad for us as our stocks will be down 2 meals""

How is that my problem?
We also got a free coffee made from mud.

I will fly Turkish airlines next time.",2,"2018",1

"Pegasus-Airlines","Turkish EasyJet","I also read all the bad reviews and was quiet apprehensive of our trip. Consider Pegasus the Turkish EasyJet and you’re not far wrong. The new jets are comfy enough the older not so much. We bought all our food on board and just bought drinks which were reasonable enough. Sterling, Euros or card were accepted.

Just one thing to note if you’re connecting to another flight in Istanbul. You have to go through another security check with the worst organisation I’ve ever seen. Plan at least a 2hr layover or you may miss your flight.",2,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Bargain Flight","Having read a lot of reviews about Pegasus,Iwas a little worried about the level of service to expect, well what a wonderful surprise to find smiling happy staff always ready to help. The food and drinks available on board were of a good standard , similar to Easyjet.
The flights were all on time but where the staff deserve a special mention is, when we arrived for the stopover in Istanbul we arrived a little early , I saw a flight for Stanstead on the screen but didn't realise it was an earlier flight than the one I had reserved,at the gate the staff politely told me I had made a mistake and should wait for my flight which would leave a couple of hours later, so I asked if there was space on the earlier departure. again the staff could not have been more helpful or charming and indeed they found space for me to take the eralier flight.In comparrison to so many other companies Pegasus were superior and I thank you all at Pegasus for that and I look forward to flying Pegasus again soon.",2,"2018",5

"Pegasus-Airlines","Good airline with affordable prices!","I regularly fly with Pegasus & will continue to do so in the future.

Prices are affordable & reasonable, although to fly to North Cyprus in the summer can be very expensive if you don't book early!

I usually use this airline to fly to UK,Turkey & North Cyprus, it was my first time flying to Paris with them & I wasnt disappointed.

Very rarely have I encountered delays when flying with them & staff are always friendly, although I feel a couple of times could have dealt with certain situations differently.

Overall a good airline which I would recommend & would deffernatley fly with again. I even have a Pegasus club account which is great for getting discounts off flights.",2,"2018",4

"Pegasus-Airlines","Not that cheap really","1st time to travel with a supposedly cheap airlines , it was a lousy deal , we could have used direct flights with a good airlines ,got a decent meals, seating and not that far away airport with little money difference . it was not worth it at all",1,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","THE WORST AIRLINES EVER","THE WORST AIRLINES EVER! I was traveling back and at the counter they weighted everything and it was ok I showed the guy a piece and asked if it’s ok to take to the plane in the cabin and he said yes along with our hand luggages and that piece weighted nothing (3 kg max) and the guy said no problem don’t pay any extra fees. when boarding they stopped us and asked to weigh everything again and asked to weigh the backpacks which is weird because I travel alot with so many airlines (low cost and others) and none asked for the backpack weight as it’s considered a personal luggage. here they took everything from us and asked us to pay for 70 kg extra! and refused to admit their mistake and refused to let us go on the airplane unless we pay all the money. It’s not about the money we could’ve paid the extra but they should have said that from the beginning in the check in counter. They embarrassed us and were yelling at us and tried to reach our pockets and wallets to take the money from us by force and when we asked for the police or anyone in charge they started yelling and making fun of us and refused to call anyone. Very BAD and truly THE WORST airlines and customer service!!!!!!",1,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Uncomfortable and too expensive!!!!","The seats are very tight next to each other and the plane was full. No room to breath. No food, not even peanuts or water. This can be expected in local flights, but for a 4 hrs international flight this was too much (even for a budget airline). The worst was that I took this flight to save some money, but could not check in on line and could not pay for the excess luggage. This meant I had to pay at the airport twice the normal fee. The counter weighted even our hand luggage and forced us to move items into the checked luggage which increased the fee. The return flight was delayed without any explanation.",1,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Delay and Lies - Never Fly with Pegasus Airlines","Delays are probable in any flight. Likewise out flight from Istanbul to Konya on November 25th was delayed. The delay was more than 4 hours. The airline company, Pegasus, announced that there ""might"" be a new additional flight or the passengers may be shifted to the next flight. Some passengers updated the boarding passes some did not because airline did not give any clear information. Seat numbers were confused. Although they called the passengers after 4 hours, they waited us on the gate. Then said it is because few refill. They took us to the plane which is in the parking hangar and was not ready. They waited us more than 1 hour in the plane. Then captain announced the they would take fuel. The parking plane was out of fuel. The fuel truck came. And we waited and waited. Almost every single personnel of the airlines lied from the start to the end. Only prefer this airline if the price is the only decision parameter. Otherwise never fly with them. By the way, just sometime ago this airline made an accident in Trabzon city in Istanbul.",1,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","One of the worse low cost airlines","Pegasus is one of the worse low cost airlines you can fly. Firstly, the flights are constantly delayed and the planes themselves and smaller than average in terms of space.

Secondly, their customer service is pretty bad. I was told on the phone that I could rebook for free because of special circumstances and when I called again to rebook they told me this was impossible. However, they advised me to file a complaint and if I was actually told this I would be entitled to what I was told. I filed a complaint and gave them the timestamp of when I was told this information, only to get a reply a week later with a standardized message indicating they never listened to the message.

Overall, wouldn't recommend unless absolutely necessary.",1,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","No frills, low cost airline. Be prepared for a short delay.","We flew Dusseldorf- Istanbul-Antalya and back. Two out of the four take-offs (in Istanbul and Antalya) were 15 to 30 minutes later than scheduled because the pilot had to wait for a new time slot. International travellers flying into Antalya, through Istanbul, should be aware that the plane will land on the Domestic Antalya Terminal but that their checked-in luggage will be in the International Terminal which cannot be reached by foot. So, once you step out of the plane in Antalya into the gate, ask for the shuttle to take you to the International Terminal. Do not walk any further, because you cannot walk back once you leave the gate area and you will need to take a cab after bagage claim. Allegedly (we got this confirmed by 3 airport employees), Pegasus is not always clear in communicating this to its international passengers. And yes, we had to take a cab after waiting fruitlessly for our luggage to arrive at baggage claim ...",1,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst airline ever","This is the worst airline ever and I'm a frequent traveler who also flew with small Asian and African companies.
I've took Pegasus airlines during Christmas time for a vacation in Antalya. It was terrible on so many levels. The first flight from Amsterdam was with a connection in Istanbul where we had to go out the international area completely and needed to go through security checks again which is ok. I've asked when still in the international area if I need to recover my bags and I was told not to. I've asked again at Pegasus office and it was confirmed that I will have to pick up my luggage at final destination. We had 1h delay. Once arrived at Antalya around 1:00 in the morning, no luggage. And with the mind peace of the world the responsible at Pegasus office said that I have to go to another terminal which is 5 km away and need to take a cab for it. No information about this on the ticket or at Istanbul, and no apologies from the responsible at Antalya Pegasus Office, he handed a paper to "" fill a complaint"". My first visit to Turkey didn't start that good. By the way taxi drivers do not speak English or languages other than Turkish (at least at the airport).
For the return flight, the problems continued. Huge delay at Antalya, and after we landed at Istanbul once again I had to check out and redo passport/security checks while the flight time of the second flight Istanbul-Amsterdam was maintained. The announcement of the flight was on last call while I was still standing on passport checks. I've finished running trough the airport to arrive at the gate, and when complaining about the organization, once again no reaction as if it was normal.
First and last time flying with Pegasus... DO NOT RECOMMEND AT ALL!",1,"2018",1

If you have a chance please avoid using a lowcoaster airlines. For Turkey I would recommend using Turkish Airlines (THY) and you can get similar price of you bought your tickets in advance.
THY luggage allowances 23kg, free meals and on-board entertainment, so it would be equal value.",1,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Fraud with businessflex","This booking was a fraud. When you book a Business Flex ticket it says very clear that it can be refunded without a fee. For free.
I had to cancel my booking for reason on time (more than 24 hours in advance). I was charged something around 30 EUR. When I was canceling the booking the website was in English except for one string in Turkish saying I have to pay 30 EUR with no chance to unflag this option. The support was helpless (number 00359078).
It's a very primitive ""fraud"" changing my attitude to the air company forever.

When we got onto the aircraft the overhead luggage compartments were all full, so I had to stow my hand luggage 25meters towards the back of the plane.

I had taken my 3 x child car seats with me on my holiday as we were renting a vehicle during our stay in Istanbul. On the way from stansted we had no problems and the check -in staff accepted our seats which were wrapped carefully by ourselves with plastic wrap to protect them in transit. On the way back when we tried to check in for our return flights the check- in staff refused to accept our seats although they were wrapped exactly the same as before. They wanted us to buy 3 x ridiculously large draw string bags which were too oversized in my opinion was more likely to snag on the conveyor belt. No explanation they didn't want to listen and I had no choice and had to pay it.",1,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","They need better pilots","The crew were miserable but probably don’t blame them with the type of people that travel in this airline, this was a first with a budget airline as I always use emirates airlines or so, must say leg room is better than most budget airline and although they are small planes they are okay, the only thing we hated was that the pilot doesn’t know how to land a plane, he braked so hard in istanbul maybe because the runway was to small but in stansted airport it was so bad the plane was skidding and he still had half the runway to go like how stupid is he?

The departure was cancelled literally for an hour before departure though even the front desk has been defined. Any compensation. Only a refund for the ticket or exchange for flight which had to take place allegedly in 2 days!!! And what to do these 2 days in the unfamiliar city?! It is natural to spend money, to incur unplanned expenses. Awful company, budgetary, planes same. All flight me was covered by feeling that we already fall. Such feeling for long-term practice of flights visited me too for the first time. Chairs - wafer-thin as stools, at movie theaters and that is wider. Don't feed. But it is even better, I am afraid that food would be intolerable. I think that it is better to overpay 10-20% and to fly other companies, it will be more reliable and more pleasant than the same Turkish Airlines.",1,"2018",1

I went to the office for report and wrote an email to the company without receive any answer.
During time I tried again and again to write but nothing,so the customer service doesn't reply to the problems occurred during the service,and no one took care aboute the damaged of my baggage.
It's a shame that this happens and no one reply to me.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Careless with important baggage and not enough fuel in the plane","Pegasus do not care about customer welfare. They see you as a pound / Euro sign occupying their seat - not a human being.

During a brief layover at Istanbul (SAW), arriving from London Stansted, my wife and I were unable to collect our bags to transfer them onto our flight for the second leg of our journey. We consulted an uninterested member of Pegasus staff who personally promised to transfer the bags onto our next flight. He told us not to worry...

We explained how important the bags were, as one contained my wife's supply of vital diabetes medication. We were told we could not carry it in hang luggage - hence its presence in check-in baggage.

The bag never made it onto the flight.

We waited for 2 hours at baggage reclaim in Kuwait but our bag never arrived. It has left my wife fighting her diabetes without the help of her medication. It is a fight she is losing as her blood sugar keeps rising. She is now at serious risk of further high blood sugar and diabetic coma.

I am in the process of pleading with Pegasus. I haven't had a response, any assurance or an update on the lost case. Their after-sale support is atrocious. They simply do not care or value the lives of passengers.

I should also add that, during take off from Istanbul, the plane aborted taking off because the pilot realised there was not enough fuel in the plane. We waited for 2 hours on the tarmac while the plane refuelled. Guess I should be thankful that at least one employee of Pegasus has some common sense and can do their job properly - imagine if he'd realised at 30,000 feet.

A disgusting company who simply don't care about people. Do not use this airline. I know it is cheap but you cannot put a price on safety. Pegasus you should be ashamed.",1,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Turkish low cost","They are beyond the lowcost. I don’t remember any bad experience with them.
I bought the ticket in July for last week of december. It was about 500 lira ( 110 euro) Trabzon to İstanbul, İstanbul to Madrid and back the route. It was include 20 kg baggage and meal.
I took my baggage so speedly in Trabzon. I ask the staff “how come” he said Pegasus has own company for this. I am glad to hear that.
Meal was good warm and tasty.",1,"2018",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","awful","What an awful flight. The seats are the smallest they could possibly be. We took this flight after an already long journey. The legroom was as tight as it gets. When the person in front reclines they may as well be sleeping in your lap. If they did have entertainment it would be useless as you are too close to the seat in front to properly focus.
I'm not sure when airline travel took this dive. It can't get worse.
It was a four hour flight that felt much longer.",1,"2018",1

"Pegasus-Airlines","Budget Airline","This is a good airline with inexpensive tickets. The planes are new, the service is good. It's convenient for me because I can fly from my city to many cities in Europe with the layover in Istanbul. In my opinion, Pegasus Airlines have only big disadvantage. It's a lack of drink/meal service on the flights.",1,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst night ever","We were sitting next to the gate and they did not announce and even they did not bother to mention our names and they closed the gate, we asked them and they asked us to go to transit office, we went there and they sent us to another office, one office after another till they asked for 300$ extra we thought the problem has been solved we told them we already paid 824$ then she said give me 200$ and put us on the second day flight at 21:55, we were left in the airport then we had to stay one night at the ISG hotel next to the airport, I missed a meeting on the next day and got warning from work, it was the worst experience ever, while on the next day they made the whole passengers wait for 25 minutes because someone lost his bag while we are two passengers they left the day before without us and made us loose work meeting and paid extra 200$ plus the hotel fees.",1,"2018",1

Only in the airport I was informed that my flight ticket is actually in two parts and the airlines were Gulf air and Pegasus airlines which do not have any code share agreements between them. That means I am supposed to check out my luggage in the connecting airport(Bahrain) for which I was supposed to have a visa. Since I was not informed about the two different tickets, I failed to take a transit visa and I was not allowed to board the flight. So, I had to miss my flight and struggling to get a refund from them.",1,"2018",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Getting what you paid for felt in pain and agony of delays and disappointment...","Booked Pegasus coz family said, ""we're flying to Istanbul on Pegasus, use the same flight, it should be good""
What a disaster. Sure, there was mist in Dubai, so the plane was delayed. BY 9 HOURS!
So: Take off time was 6am, so we got to the airport by 3:15, saw the 4am plane's people check in and board and take-off. All looked fine, even though there was fog.
Then we hear that we will be delayed due to the fog... apparently our incoming plane was diverted due to the fog. So we get told it will be 2 hours... Fine, there's fog, we'll wait 2h.. However:
Not once did Pegasus give any indication of what is happening, just that we're delayed initially but not any further information - then we got told not to keep asking, and that they'll tell us. 4h, 5h 6...
Eventually we grab lunch and come back to the gate, NO pegasus people anywhere. The Dnata team was there, quite handy in letting us know that the plane was diverted, stuck in Bahrain, and they don't know more, but usually it'll only come in when the fog clears.
After 8h I recognise the check-in person near the gates (with Pegasus Uniform), and follow them to the Gate, where they still don't say a thing, even when asked. Just that they'll let us know, and that we should just stay near the gate. While Dubai Airports are fair, Terminal 2 isn't known for being the best airport to ""hang around in"", and sadly, after 8 hours, it felt like every sick person sleeping on the ground was coughing on us!
9h into the day and without any announcements, the Gate opens up, the Pegasus person starts loading people on a bus, and we all board. Great - only missed one day in Turkey.
Get on the plane and the seats can't recline, there is absolutely no entertainment possibility, my phone battery is already dying because we spent so much time trying to find out what will happen and when - nothing on the Pegasus Flight Info centre either. So when my battery dies, I just try to nod off - luckily at 5'9"", the legroom works for me, but my poor son at 6'3"", had to sit skew for his legs to fit in! Just a normal seat, and while covered in some black almost leather looking material, thin as a plank and obviously built for cost saving, this was just not the most comfortable ride ever. They usually sell food on these flights, which I'd be happy to pay for, but due to the earlier morning issues, the plane for some reason wasn't stocked, so they literally had no food or drinks! Mind you, on the return flight, they had, and while you're paying to eat the food in the air, if you don't have $ or Euro's, don't expect their online Credit Card system to work - Mine didn't (5 card from 2 different countries didn't - all with money available) The card machine just didn't accept it. Not just me, but at least 5 guys in my vicinity didn't have cash in the currency that they want ($, Euros or Turkish Lira) but not the destination currency of UAE Dirhams. I couldn't even get coffee or water, because the water is priced such that even the leftover coins I had in Lira, was not enough!
All in all, poor day in the weather, but the plane, service and flight options were just pathetic... won't ever do that again.",1,"2018",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst going and coming ever","Went with this airline on 2016 and my flight got delayed from Dubái to Madrid. When I arrived my luggaged was missing. I made the claim and they told me that they were going to send it to me. Finally after waiting for 2 days Ihad to go to the airport looking for it and I discovered that they only had 1 employee that obviously was gonna take for ever to find it and send it to me.
When I flew back to Dubái the first flight got delayed again! I lost my second flight and when I went to make my claim they wanted me to pay for another flight making it look like it was my fault. Finally the guy on the desk checked the flights and realized that I lost my flight because the first flight was delayed. I spent the night on a hotel they provided me in Istanbul.
The next day finally got on the plane and when I arrived guess what? My luggage was missing again!
Another man was on my same situation from the day before and when we asked about the lugagges missing we fount that the lugagges arrived on the flight we had lost.
I would never fly with Pegasus in my life.",1,"2018",1

"Pegasus-Airlines","I would rather take direct flights with other airlines to avoid the hustle","Food is worthless and wont order it again for sure ,water should be given free of charge when requested",1,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Zu Teuer","300 Euro für eine Reise für eine Person vom Stuttgart nach Istanbul ist sehr teuer.
at the gate they were suspecting that we are leaving to Germany, they asked for my bank card!",1,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Pleasantly surprised","This was the first time with Pegasus for us. Having read some of the online reviews, we were a little worried. But - this was far better than many other airlines. I think that the most important thing is not how they behave when everything goes smoothly, but how they behave whenever a problem arises. And this was first class.

Arriving at Oslo Airport we were told the plane was about 2.5 hrs late in from Istanbul. Immediately we were given food coupons, and told to just relax. Our connection in Istanbul was only 1 hr 15 minutes, so this would not be possible. WE were told this would be taken care of at the gate or in Istanbul.

Plane left 2 hrs late. A little cramped, but OK. Service was good, smiling and friendly crew. We had the Advantage Packet and so got our sandwiches - very good. Flight was nice.

Upon landing in Istanbul we were looking for a transfer og rebooking desk when we noticed a couple of Pegasus employees standing close by the exit, and shouting ""anyone for izmir? Ankara"" an so on. We went over, and they just swapped our boarding passes with new ones. Tickets were stanped with a food option, so we just had to go to the main terminal and show our tickets to get an OK meal.

Flight into Izmir and back was uneventful. Transiting through Sabiha Gökcen is FAR easier than the always overcrowded Atatürk Airport.

So, this is a budget airline. You get what you pay for. Like Norwegian or Southwest. But the handling of the delay was first class. We have been delayed before, but never nothing like this happened (Continental/United flat out refused any help at all).

One thing I noticed was that while the crew was demnding that everyone turn their electronic devices off (full off) during take off and landing, they did not bother to stop people from walking around the cabin during turbulence. In my mind a somewhat reverse attitude. But it did not bother me.

In short - we will use Pegasus again.",1,"2018",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","good no frill airline with lots of destinations","This is good airline for the price you pay. it is like all other no frill airlines doesn't have the leg room or the comfortable seats you desire, but it is well priced tickets, on board the food and beverage you buy is relatively well priced and good quality. Lots of destinations and very frequent. I traveled from Istanbul to Izmir for $26!",1,"2018",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Value for money","We have booked this airline because it was cheap and convenient. The plane was a new Airbus A320,leg room was good for a budget airline. We have booked our tickets 3 months in advance and paid 140TL inc meal&extra baggage. The flight was on time and cabin crew been attentive during our 1 hour flight to Antalya. Overal good value for money and will definately use this airline again for short journies.",1,"2018",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Left Stranded without a Country","After we had left the airplane we realized that our passport packet was on our seat ,not allowed to return to the plane we had to wait in the police station not knowing what was going to happen.It took over 5 hours for us to finally get our identification back.The plane that we came in on had already refueled and was back in Istanbul. They still said they couldn't located the folder!!!We found out that the plane was there through relatives in Turkey we still don't know who detained us long enough to miss our connecting flight the police or the airline but they sure were not concerned about us getting home or making our flight!!!Words said like if we cannot locate we will have to send you back to Istanbul wow real nice a 5 minute issue turned into a huge cost with no resolve extra money spent that we really couldn't afford.Thank God we didn't forget the baby on the plane?We travel quite a bit but this has to be the worst issue we've had that could have been diffused quickly without any issues not sure about there policies but sometimes rules should be broken someone from the staff could have went with me?In the flurry of leaving the plane make sure you got everything even if your getting rude looks they might not let you turn around to go back!!!",12,"2017",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Rip off merchants with poor customer service","I tried to book a flight with Pegasus Airlines and got various error messages including ""Your authentication could not be completed because of a system error. If this happens consistently, please contact your CSR"", which was nothing to do with my payment card as it eventually worked using the same card. However, when I was finally able to book the price had gone up so I contacted customer services and was simply fobbed off by stating its to do with my bank so if that's the case why does it say ""system error"" not ""payment error"" and why say to contact ""CSR"" and not my bank if it's an issue with my card???

I won't be flying with these con merchants in future knowing how poor their customer service is and they couldn't care less.",12,"2017",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","A terrible airline with such bad service - I have experience: I fly 60+ times a year...","After a very bad experience two years ago, I tried Pegasus again. And it was again completely chaos! No delay announced, no different gate but suddenly, already long after boarding time, we had to change gates (from G2 to D6...) which is a 15 minutes walk to another building. Call it a run since there was no indication of when it would take off! Older people, people with children, running... Then D6 was not D6, it is D6A, D6B, D6C, but no specification (it was D6 L). We left almost 2 hours too late, arrived 1 hour too late... and no excuses, not even a small bottle of water - I was waiting for 3 hours at the gate... a shame! I fly 60+ times a year, but this sole experience with Pegasus (after 2 years after another bad experience) shows that they cannot handle it! Just terrible. And to be sure: There is NO In-flight entertainement, there is NO food and beverage (unless if you pay - and this after hours of waiting before boarding) - and it was dirty, certainly when I left and I saw how the other people just threw their food on the floor... since there are no bags and the personnel does not collect the garbage at the end of the flight?",12,"2017",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Istanbul-Antalya","This company is always late! The rate is low, but you have to accept if you fly with Pegasus you will be for sure late and unpredictable for how long. Just relax and accept it and then the rest will be fine:))",12,"2017",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Too budget airline - extra fees for everything","The quality is not worth the money. I had a flight with transfer without luggage and without snacks on inconvenient time (departure at 2 a.m., 6 hours transfer, 14 p.m. arrival) with awful seats in both planes. The price was the same as the price of the direct flight with food and luggage with Iranian airline. Well, i couldn't buy the ticket in advance, if I would have bought it a week earlier - I wouldn't choose Pegasus, and off course I won't choose it in any conditions anymore.

If you wanna buy a ticket from Pegasus - take into account that my height is 170 cm and my knees were pushing the front seat. You have to pay for extra space (as for many extra options which can make your flight more or less okey). I wouldn't say anything if the price for a flight was lower - but it equals the price of direct flight with all the services included by another airline. Think twice and buy in advance - not from Pegasus.",12,"2017",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Respect for my musical instrument","As a musician, I need to travel often to Turkey. Pegasus Airlines have always been very polite and helpful with my portable Harp, finding solutions if the flight is full, such as a safe cabinet in the aircraft, or allowing me to enter and put my instrument at an empty seat. I always have felt taken care, versus other experiences with other companies, for example, Aeroflot. Respect to the musicians is number one reason to chose an air company. So, not serving coffee or food on the flight really does not matter, since the price of the ticket is low.",12,"2017",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Lek","My first experience with Pegasus was awful. The flight was delayed for three hours 20 mins without any information nor remedy from the airline staff. I got the message from the phone. I would not choose this airline again.",12,"2017",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","OK for Budget Airline","Check in slow and painful. Could not check in on line. Plane OK and nice and clean. Flight delayed both ways but acceptable. Nothing is free on Pegasus flights. Biggest problem was Stansted Airport. Will never fly from there again. Did not respond to my complaint",12,"2017",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Nice Trip","Really it is a nice, clean and friendly airlines. The Cabin was very clean and the staff was very friendly. The flight left on time.",12,"2017",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","It's A Budget Airline - You Get What You Pay For","Flew up to Istanbul to see a friend. Only an hour from Fethiye where I live flying out of Dalaman. Pegasus is a budget airline along the lines of EasyJet and RyanAir in the UK. So basically you get what you pay for!!! Keep that in mind before you complain and grumble.

But I must say all in all, not a bad experience. Going to Istanbul just had 'normal' seat, but even that had way much more leg room than the UK counterparts. Seats are OK, but I was only in it an hour..;¬) Cabin staff polite and attentive on my flight. Even with just the hour flight, they managed to serve refreshments to the whole of the plane.

Coming back I did pay for extra legroom seat and ordered food, costing me just 65TL (approximately £12) for both. Food was surprisingly tasty and not bad for an in-flight meal on a budget airline.

Note with Pegasus you get 15Kg hold luggage as standard, plus 8Kg carry on.

And as a comparison for you, flight with Pegasus £48, same flight distance with EasyJet £130. So all in all Pegasus a GREAT choice",12,"2017",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Pegasus airline NOT recommended","I would definitely not recommend Pegasus airlines. On a 4:40 min flight how can they not offer to hydrate their customers with water at no extra cost? No complimentary snacks or food. This is unheard of in NA. They have rules where over a certain amount of flight time they HAVE to offer complimentary water and food. Like 2 hours. EXTREMELY tight seating. Staff for the most part was workable but had some rude interactions too. AND it was more expensive than airline out of Bahrain (in retrospect).",12,"2017",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Uncomfortable flight and very rude cabin crew","My experience with Pegasus Airlines not went well, flight from Bahrain to SAW Istanbul was 4 hours and i was expecting something good and excited experience. In website they are making fool to people with some kind of Essential, Advantage and Business Flex options in reality there is no any difference on any option all seats are same just they’ll share some sandwich meal on Advantage option. When i was returning back at night I felt so thirsty in flight so i went to cabin crew and asked for water and told him I'll pay you at landing time because I couldn't find my hand bag where I kept my wallet and he clearly refused and then I insist I'm really thirsty so he just gave me half of glass water from bottle from which I wasn't satisfied so I asked him to give me more please so he said clearly NO for water.

NO flight entertainments at all.
Unhelpful rude cabin crew even ground staff though.

"Pegasus-Airlines","With PEgasus to Norther Cyprus","We recently booked via Cyprus Pardise to go th Kyrenia. The flight times were reasonable. We knew we would pause in Turkey. However our flights were changed after we had paid the full amount. We now had 3 hours in Istambul. I tried to change with Cyprus Paradise they refused said I would have to loose my money and rebook. In the event after getting on the plane we were held for over an hour before take off. On the flight we had Turkish drunks preparing to fight each other. WHen we ordered wine from the trolley the drunk sitting next to me became wild because they served me and not him. Most alarming. There was chaos at Istambul transfer. We. Got to our hotel 2.30 a.m rather than 10 p.m. Th return flight was equally bad with the 3 hour delay in Istambul.",12,"2017",1

"Pegasus-Airlines","Cheap","Cheap s the best I can say. We have used Pegasus for many many many years. It has always been cheap and basic. However, for our last 3 flights, we have had new aircraft. Great - you would think. No. It seems, that in order to maintain the price efficiency, they have made huge changes in their aircraft. The seats have never been the most comfortable. However, these new aircraft are unbelievably basic. Uncomfortable with hardly any padding. To our horror - none of the seats recline! Sitting for 3.5/4 hours in a bolt upright position is excruciating. I am only 4’10” but even I found the seating ridiculously cramped.
The seat trays no longer extend, so you have to stretch to eat or drink. There is not even a pocket in the seat in front to put books/magazines etc. Probably the worst flights we have ever made!
However, as they are the only airline to provide direct flights on this route, we will have to put up with it until another airline joins this route. PLEASE MAKE IT SOON - because we would rather pay a bit more to be comfortable.",12,"2017",1

"Pegasus-Airlines","Via Istanbul","I fly with this airline in the Winter, depending on the time you have on the ground in Istanbul, it can be very rushed,I have often been worried about losing my connecting flight and this year on the way to London, we had to wait on the tarmac while 13 peoples bags were unloaded as they could not make the time, due to machinery having broken down at the airport. However, the service is ok, the food however, is not so nice, but, not terrible either. I paid a high price but if you book well in advance the prices are generally good. The staff are friendly and the planes themselves new. This time around I had over 3 hours between flights and it was lovely, I disembarked at my own pace, not a panic, had a much needed cigarette on the terrace once I had gone through to domestic departures, a nice cup of coffee etc. and a relaxed time between the two flights.",12,"2017",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Above average budget airline","Very punctual, well organized boarding and friendly airside personel. Free Tea/coffee and snack of fair quality, other budget airlines charge for worse. Plane was ok and clean, check-in swift and unproblematic.
Will surely chose Pegasus again.",12,"2017",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","I did not want to be cruel","I am speechless, I cannot say anything positive. You must pay even for a water.Seats are crummy, uncomfortable, the food served (pricey) and not appealing. If you don't eat or drink, basically the service is not for you. So maybe it is good if you don't like to interact with anybody.",12,"2017",2

Not worth the money and time to book it!","I booked a Flex-ticket (30€ more) just to get a free sandwich...no drink included (not even a glass water or coffee)...very small seat space...the mobile phone app not working properly (tried to reschedule a booking and was not possible)...low cost airline with no fun to fly!

"Pegasus-Airlines","Great value and service","I walked past the huge queue for people on flights with famous package holiday companies to a quiet desk and a friendly welcome. Check in was easy at the desk.
The food on the flight was better than the average and leg room was fine for my 31"" inside leg. I had had to phone the company to correct a name spelling and the phone service was excellent and no charge for the change. How refreshing. I would travel with Pegasus again.",12,"2017",4

"Pegasus-Airlines","Low cost flight","Pegasus airlines is one of the low cost airline companies in Turkey. You can prefer it on the short flights. Every service including normal baggage and meal on the board means extra cost. But the tickets are really affordible if you buy the ticket 3 or 4 months before your trip.
I usually fly with this airlines.",12,"2017",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Great option for a low-cost flight","A good value for money flight option. The service is good, the planes are clean and modern. Had a few flights with this airline in the last couple of years. They manage to maintain the same level of quality despite the low ticket price. For a low-cost airline, Pegasus is really a worth to consider option when travelling on a budget.",12,"2017",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Unannounced delay of 2 hrs 45 minutes","So this is budget airline, but does that mean it can waste your time by not notifying passengers in advance about an almost 3 hour delay! No! We got to the aiport 3 hours before out flight and had to wait 30 minutes in the online checked in passengers line. Extremely slow services to start with. Then the person at the counter told us there would be 3 hours delay and we asked why we were not notified before. No answer. He said we would be given vouchers at the gate for the delay, so even thougj we would have a 3 hour delay we HAD to be at the gate to receive voucher otherwise they would not be giving it to us!!!!! (Yes sir!) Guess how much the value of the voucher was! 6 euros! And the cost of a bottle of evian eater at Barcelona terminal 2 cafe is 3.25 euros. That really doesnt cover much does it??? They announced boarding but did not start boarding people so the system woupd not show too much delay for them... Liars! The plane started taxi 2 hours 55 minutes late. Non-reclining seats, expensive inflight food and beverages and rude flight attendants. If you thinking of booking pegasus airlines tickets, think twice. Is it worth the misery? Maybe in rare instances!...",12,"2017",2

"Pegasus-Airlines","Just do your research on Pegasus","I have never flown pegasus before but i can assure you that i will never fly it again. Pegasus is a budget airline. You must pay for food & drinks. Being mid air did not help making payment as their eftpos machine takes forever for a transaction to go through it keeps declining and they re-process the transaction about 5 times. The service is below average. You cannot understand what the captain says its all muffled and the turbulence was frightening. The take off and landings were the absolute worst that i have experienced and having my children with me made it extra frightening. I used Pegasus for a trip booked in advance therefore used them for connecting flights (4 times) and i can tell you that this experience was not one off hence the decision in not wanting to use this service again. Do yourself a favour and do some research prior to making your booking. Ill be looking for a premium flight next time round thats for sure.",12,"2017",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Very narrow seats","Seats are very narrow, staff are not friendly and no flight entertainments.all empty space filled up with advertusement banners.nothing served but with money.. might ask money very soon to use wc in flight. AND IT IS NOT THAT CHEAP AS MENTIONED IN ADVERT...

Not recommend to the travellers",12,"2017",1

"Pegasus-Airlines","Sometimes cheap and reasonable.","Pegasus Airline is a economic airline. The flights' quality are high. The air crafts are OK. You will not be served during the flight unless you buy it yourself inside the cabin or previously through the website. Sometimes the prices inside the turkey are great. The policy of refunding and cancelling the flights are NOT fair.",12,"2017",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","I flew with Pegasus. I did not hear excuses for the delay.","I flew with this airline from northern Cyprus to Istanbul and then from Istanbul to my city. The plane arrived at Ercan airport in Cyprus with 1 hour delay the plane took off at 12, 35 instead of 11, 35. I was in a group of tourists and I feared that the flight from Istanbul to my city will be lost as the boarding time had passed and the plane had not arrived from Istanbul to Ercan.The travel agency chose this airline. It was not my choice for the flight company. When the plane came, the passengers walked on the plane and boarded the front and rear doors. But some passengers have not realized that if they have seats on the back row they have to climb the back stairs, so they climbed the front ladder. Several passengers boarded the rear ladder but had seats in front. So they met in the middle and there was a lock in finding places. During the flight, Pegasus did not offer a glass of water or anything else. If passengers wanted something they could buy in euros. The stewardess who was talking to us at the microphone spoke very quickly, I only understood a few words of what he was saying.But as good parts of this company's airplane I can say that the spaces in the airplane are wide, the seats are comfortable, I've had plenty of space in the chair. The landing was not smooth, but I was pleased to have arrived in Istanbul to run to catch another airplane. The suitcase suffered a few bumps but I was too tired from 9 am to 4 pm in the afternoon to make the bendings more important.",12,"2017",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","local-speaking staff is an advantage","The service you receive is quite acceptable in comparison to amount you have paid. The aircraft was brand new and clean, also I found out this airlines puts local-speaking staff for each route which is very helpful for passengers with language problems.
The flight fee is cheap, so If you prefer to eat or drink, you should buy inside aircraft.",12,"2017",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Great airline","Ihavs flown numerous times with Pegasus and always found them to be efficient, their planes are clean and comfortable. My only negative comment is their website which can be difficult to navigate in English.",12,"2017",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Little gem!","What a pleasant surprise! Apart from the unearthly time of the flight and the extremely difficult ticketing buying palava on their app....once we were on the plane it was plain sailing. Lovely little plane and great flight. Amazingly generous luggage allowance...30 kgs hold allowance and 8 kgs cabin, and the turn around of the suitcases was incredible in Bishkek. Everything was waiting for us in The airport after we had cleared customs. The in flight food and drink prices were a bargain too...although make sure if you want a hot meal to order it when you book your ticket.....so Pegasus...smarten up your act on the online booking procedure and make it easier for non-Turkish citizens to join up without having to spend hours muddling through trying to get a British mobile phone number into your non-British mobile phone boxes on your login page......and you'll be up there with the world's best.",12,"2017",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","But for ground staff at Istanbul it would have been ""Very Good""","We were possibly the first to check in for the flight and were very well-received. Information about hold and cabin allowances was spontaneously given, and e were able to put so much more into the hold than on our way out (with a different airline). I even entrusted my laptop to the hold!

The only difficulty we had was at Istanbul in the small hours of the morning. I need a wheelchair and there was considerable, and in some cases, grumpy difficulty over getting all of us and our hand baggage to the gate for the connecting flight. My chair driver moaned that she might get the sack for allowing a three year-old to sleep on my knee (at 3am) but my offer to give my name and professional and contact details in case of difficulty, was rejected.

The flight was absolutely full, but the crew did their very best. I did not see any in-flight entertainment, but most people just wanted to sleep.

The service at Stansted, in debarking and getting through the necessary procedures, was first class.

As a low-cost airline, I would recommend it.",12,"2017",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Fly PGS","I always prefere to fly with PEGASUS the planes are brand new, the crews are very professional. This is the best law cost airlines in Turkey. The meals are in hight quality. But you must order for the hot meals 24hours before your flight. In Turkey you can have 5kg cabin baggage plus 15kg baggage. But in international baggage you have right to carry 8kg as cabin baggage for additional baggage you can buy before your flight. It’s cheaper. I recommend",11,"2017",5

"Pegasus-Airlines","No frills but fine!","Pegasus, as a carrier, was almost completely unmemorable; it was a slightly turbulent flight from Istanbul to Izmir, and there was no food or drink service. The staff were efficient and polite although otherwise not present (perhaps due to the turbulence or that it was a short flight), and the plane was clean. I don't recall any in-flight entertainment, although I had brought a book as the flight was not too long at all. No frills at all, but fine for a short hop somewhere. I'm not sure what Pegasus is like for longer flights, but as long as one brought a book and didn't fly more than a few hours, it seemed safe and had exceptionally low prices. I would recommend it to anyone who wasn't expecting a big production so much as just a nice place flight for a good price, easy check in and boarding, slightly dirty plane interior, could have used a little more communication from the pilot during that turbulence because passengers were crying (it was a domestic flight in Turkey, and I had the feeling that it was not unusual for people to cry on planes in turbulence, pretty openly, even though it was only a little mild... and I say this as an ABSOLUTELY phobic flier!)",11,"2017",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","convienant flight","convenient flight, low baggage allowance, no free service offered on board. seats are comfortable with fine leg space.",11,"2017",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Budget Flight Cheaper than Bus fare","We are shocked when we booked the flight for two of us as the total fare was more or less than bus fare for the same distance. It is no frill flight, was on time, and reached before time. We could get from counter the exit seat what we want as this had more leg space. As it was short flight, we did not use any of the services, overall it was good for the price.",11,"2017",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Budget & No Frills!","The ONLY frill is a smile if you're lucky when you board. But that's OK because this is a BUDGET airline.
I am only 5 ft 7"" and I struggled to find a comfortable sitting position due to the lack of leg room. But that's OK because this is a budget airline.
The seat cushions were so badly worn, that when I sat down I was sitting on the metal frame of the seat. But that's OK because this is a budget airline.
Refreshments on the flight were overpriced (yes to you have to buy them in-flight). But that's OK because this is a budget airline.

At check-in, I was charged 54gbp for 3 KG excess baggage. I tried to pay using my charge card. I was informed that the machine was broken and that my card hadn't been charged, so I had to pay cash.... you know what I'm about to say! My card HAD been charged, and to date (approximately 1 month after the flight) I am still arguing with Pegasus (via email only as they don't offer a phone number for Customer Service). They didn't provide me with a CASH RECEIPT (because their system wasn't able to provide one). So here I am feeling completely 'conned', disappointed and furious. I could have put the money that they frauded out of me towards a different airline.... an honest airline with responsive Customer Service who have a 'person' you can deal with directly instead of this faceless dishonest airline.

I arrived at my destination absolutely shattered. It was the most uncomfortable experience of my life.

I very strongly suggest you do some research and find a budget airline that provides a 'face' and 'real people' for Customer Service instead of this faceless dehumanised budget airline.

I strongly recommend that you NOT fly with young children - this airline is NOT friendly let alone 'child' friendly.

If you must fly with them, insist on a CASH receipt for everything, or record the transaction with your phone cam, and take your own refreshments with you.

To be honest, I recommend that you avoid Pegasus altogether. Pay a few extra $$ for a much more comfortable and honest airline!",11,"2017",1

They said they will call us they never called!!! Thanks a lot!",11,"2017",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Cramped uncomfortable seats","Seats on both planes were very uncomfortable. On the Rome to Istanbul flight we were on anAirbus 320 with rock hard non- reclining seats. The snack service folks skipped our row, so we could not even buy some water. The flight was delayed over an hour so we barely made our connection. The transfer process was just short of a nightmare, and the guy who frisked me reeked. The second flight was a B737 packed so tight we could hardly move. The overhead bins were full.",10,"2017",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Hardly managed to join our flight","This was our first flight with Pegasus Airlines. It went fine from Amman to Ankara, Trabzon and Istanbul. When we tried to join out flight from Istanbul to Ankara we made our boarding to Gate in our boarding tickets. When we tried to go into the plane we were informed that the gate was changed?? No announcements were given, no one to direct and simply we were running and hardly joined the flight. To make things even worse, the employee in charged was totally rude, starting to blame me for the delay?? Sorry but this was the last thing to expect.",10,"2017",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Rude staff","So I have been flying Pegasus before mainly because no other airline lands on the Ghazipaza airpoft in Turkey near Alanya. This time was a disaster with guests and most likely staff where repestedly smoking in the lavatories. The whole aircraft smelled tobacco and also the forgot to charge for a ministure bottle of whine and discovered after landing and the flight attendant chased us and embarrassed us in front of all passengers as we could only pay the 7 Euros with credit card, we have no turkish or any other cash with us and it is unheard of to refuse credit card as payment and to chase a passenger and embarrass them. Oh my God.",10,"2017",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Delays and bad communication","Our flight was delayed by over 1 hour since the airline decided to wait for another delayed flight from Israel.
The plane is okay-ish but limited leg room.
When we finally arrived at the gate in Schiphol they kept us waiting for another 40 minutes. We were not allowed to leave the airline for some unknown reason. Neither the captain not the flight attendants bothered to give any decent information.
Excuses were also not given. Customer services is not really on their agenda.
If we would have arrived in time, we have left the plane at 22.15 hrs and in our case it became 23.50 hrs.",10,"2017",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","REGULAR FLIGHT FROM OTHER AIRPORT","In general the flight was ok very short fly. it was not so clean the people on board was OK ,the Air port was a little far away and the flight was not on the monitor so was difficult to know where to go,",10,"2017",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Would Fly Again if Prices were Decent","Bologna to Istanbul and back. Booking the flight, I really found the prices of prebooking the seats ridiculous and too high and rather exploitative. At Bologna airport, check in staff where accommodating, and the bag drop only counter was appreciated. Once on board, the flight attendants did their job properly but without any smiles in the process. The legroom was too tight even compared to the likes of easyJet and Ryanair. The seats were also uncomfortable. Flights took off rather delayed but landed on time (BLQ-SAW landed with a slight delay of 20 minutes). All in all, I would fly Pegasus only if the prices were to be low..",10,"2017",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Terrible customer service, I would not recommend this airline","After booking a flight for 2 passengers I realised that I had input a surname incorrectly. After searching the Pegasus website trying to find how to raise this to them I completed an online form within 24 hours of booking advising them of my mistake and asked for their assistance, I received an automated reply from Guest Relations providing me with a reference number and advising that they would respond as soon as possible. To try and rectify the issue quickly I also tried to find a telephone number for Guest Relations at Pegasus airlines, which was not easy to find on their website! I spoke to several departments who advised they were unable to provide a telephone number for Guest Relations. When I finally got through to Guest Relations I was advised that they had all gone home for the day and to try again tomorrow!
I rang the Guest Relations team the following morning and after a 20 minute phone call I was told the only option was to cancel the whole booking (2 tickets) and I would only receive a refund of £85.40 when the flight cost me £338.00 as it was more that 24 hours after the booking. I advised them that I had raised this to them within 24 hours on their online form and had tried to contact them only to be told they had gone home for the day. The Guest Relations team were very unhelpful and said there was nothing they could do. Surely they can complete a name change, I could understand if they charged an admin fee for doing this, but not to do anything at all is appalling.
I have had to book another ticket for the passenger whose surname I input incorrectly at £117.00.
The Pegasus Airlines Guest Relations has appalling customer service and I would not recommend them.",10,"2017",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Recommanded","OK service. OK planes. Value for money. They don't make a problems with your hand bags like in other low cost companies. You can have your hand bag + purse with food, etc, and they will be ok with this.",10,"2017",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Please remember, it is a low cost airline","Most Europeans flying this airline forget that they are getting to fly international at very subsidised prices. This flight will give you the same experience that a Ryanair or Easyjet would. So why so many complaints? I flew Kuwait airways as well and OH MY GOD, they were SO late. Pegasus is courteous, helpful and not as late as compared to Kuwait Airways.
Sure the no-water on flight is a bit difficult in long flights but you can always carry an empty bottle and fill it after security check-in.",10,"2017",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Very bad service, old planes, bad quality - never again!","We didn't have another choice, but I really hope that this situation will never happen to me again and I will never ever again fly with this airline! Long flights even with the connection are very hard to do - the planes are old, the toilets are dirty... you have to sit literary on the plastic chair all your flight! And service... OMG, such arrogant hospitality people I have never met before in my life! At some point, it became even funny...",10,"2017",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Didn't feel save in there. Bad service","Didn't really feel save in that plane. Quite bad organization and very old plane. Would not fly with them again.",10,"2017",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","You Save Money...BUT the Bad Experience is Not Worth It!","I understand this is a low-cost airline so I don't expect caviar food on the plane or the red carpet going to the plane...but i realized the whole bad experience in flying these low-cost airlines is just not worth it! I rather have my health, sanity, and not be upset when I fly on vacation because its just not worth the savings. When you go on vacation you want to have good experience. I flew 5 HOURS from Dubai to Istanbul and they didnt give us any food or drinks on the plane unless we paid money. How do you fly 5 hours international without giving people food or drink? That's super bad. I saw the flight attendants eating and drinking behind the curtain like pigs and customers who paid for the flight are sitting there 5 hours without water or food...shame on you! Also, there is no entertainment movies to watch on my 5 hour flight, no much leg room. So dont be fooled by the low-cost price. These guys dont care. Their fare may be low, but get ready to pay later for normal things like water on the plane, seat selection, etc... The same thing happened with WizzAir. I hope these low-cost airlines go out of business. When people go on vacation they want to feel good, not get frustrated about these non-sense things.",10,"2017",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Poor customer service and over priced","No customer service at check in or on aircraft. Staff not interested. Now you have to deplane in Istanbul and go through a transit/security it's putting and extra hour on the journey to Cyprus - we will now fly to the south and get a taxi across the border",10,"2017",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Budget airline but expensive prices","A budget airline but expensive prices. The seat space is non-existent, the food is basic.

Pay the same if not a little more and travel with a premium airline. I only travel with this airline if there is no other choice.",10,"2017",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","It's cheep, and you get to your destination on time (nothing more)","We scheduled a flight from Tel Aviv to Bologna and back, pegasus was much cheaper than the other companies, and you get what you are paying for. the flight always departs a bit late (but you getting to your destination on time :), the late departure probably calculated in the flight time )
everything costs money, food drinks and luggage,
but I really don't need drinks and food, and including the luggage price (22$ per flight) it was still the cheapest flight",10,"2017",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Part excellent and part poor, and never a full plane","Firstly three or four flight time changes in the 4 months between booking and flying. Not a massive change, just 5 minutes, then 20 minutes etc but annoying to keep track. Then I expected to be late given other reviews, and we were, 45 minutes late for our flight from Stanstead to Istanbul. And the other Pegasus fllight on the departures board was also shown as running 45 minutes late. And possibly the most uncomfortable seat I have ever encountered on a plane. It just seemed to be upright with little thigh support for me at six feet, and not even a single inch or two of recline to get it more comfortable in the three and a half hour flight. And that was in a bulkhead seat with plenty of leg room. Although perhaps we didn't need to pay for that as the flight out and back was only about 60% full. On the upside it is a reasonable cost with friendly efficient staff on board. On the return flight, which was Northern Cyprus via Istanbul to Stanstead both flights were on time and the seat comfort so much better. I'll have to check what actual planes were used on these flights if I use them again...and hope they don't change them.",10,"2017",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Budget Airlines in Turkey","Cheapest Fare from Turkey to Cyprus

"Pegasus-Airlines","A HAPPY EXPERIENCE","We booked online through their website. Webpage was easy to navigate. Our flights were to and from Istanbul Sabiha Gokcen to Dalaman. As we had come in to Turkey on a long-haul from Cape Town, we took the slightly more expensive option to accommodate our heavier luggage (20kgs plus hand luggage of about 7kgs each). We chose our seats online and took the option of having a free Wrap (very tasty) to eat en route.

We were very impressed with the excellent service we received from Pegasus – emails and sms’ to advise that one of our flights would be departing 10 minutes earlier than originally scheduled; even a telephone call from Turkey to South Africa as a follow-up to make certain sure that we knew about the departure time change. We were very impressed!

We cannot fault either flights, both air and land side. We were treated politely and with a smile all the way. Our flights were about an hour either way, so we did not find the seats too squashed or uncomfortable over such a short distance. We were given our Wraps soon after take-off before the food trolley came down the aisle which was nice because we could eat and then buy anything else we wanted.

We have used Pegasus for all our many internal Turkey flights and have always found them to be bang on time. We do not have any special membership (always believing that this journey will be our last to Turkey!) so do not enjoy any special such a membership might offer. We have also never had a language problem with their staff.

Just a word of caution – when using Pegasus from Istanbul SG allow plenty of time for check in as being a low-cost airline, there will be hoards of people – otherwise an A1 experience!",10,"2017",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worth it","OK this is not gonna be the best experience of your life but need to consider: Pegasus offers you very very cheap flights. You may find a domestic ticket which is gonna cost 5 € or an international flight whish is gonna cost 35-40 €. Of course these prices depend on the destination, but generally it is too cheap.
Also if you are interested you should sign up to their loyalty program (Pegasus Plus) and they are gonna send you e-mails when they will have an offer/discount (2 days before the announcement on their website) And don't forget, they constantly have an offer.",10,"2017",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst service ever!","I will never recomend this airline to anyone. Im a student that was traveling in Europe in my stay in Istanbul I was supposed to flight to Rome. This airliness denied my boarding to the flight because of a Visa status; the incomepent personal make me buy another ticket and the day I went to the airport they denied my boarding again without any reason this time!!! Making me loose my money and another conection flight in Rome + hotel fees.
This personal was not helpful at all, didnt gave me any reason make me lost time and money!!!!!!!",10,"2017",1

"Pegasus-Airlines","A decent low cost airlines","This is your typical low cost airline but in comparison with other British ones as EasyJet or Ryanair they are better, more flexible, free checked luggage, better leg room and service. I really was positively impressed",10,"2017",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Less Than Average Flight","the little saved sum turned to be unworthy when you experience an unpleasant ride throught out the whole process from boarding till landing and luggage pick-up.
Very low comfort level or shall i say terrible discomfort either from extremely narrow seats leaving you squeezed shoulder to shoulder with terrible legroom resulting in stiff back and joints by the arrival time.
Finally, it's worth mentioning that you are not even allowed for a free cup of water during the flight!
Highly not recommended especially for long trips!!!",10,"2017",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Punctual","I recommend on line booking for this budget airline as you get a free sandwich. The coffee is good too.

"Pegasus-Airlines","They bring you from A to B","Normally I fly Turkish a Airlines, but I wanted to check out how Pegasus performs.
So for a Turkish low cost, they are slightly cheaper on the same flights as Turkish Airlines. For the price difference, I am not going to fly Pegasus any more. I enjoy Turkish Airlines too much.
I checked in online and the website kept on going into Turkish. That was a bit annoying.
In the airport, from gate to gate, Pegasus acts like any other low cost carrier. Service is still friendly and they stopped by twice to sell you food and drinks on an almost 3-hour flight. Your space in the plane is very limited. I am larger than the average European and I had a larger than average Turk sitting next to me and I needed to lean over the aisle to be comfortable.",10,"2017",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","As expected - not very customer-friendly","It already started with the booking confirmation which only comes in Turkish. Hard to imagine that a flight company with international flight wouldn't use English as their standard communication language. This is being continued with the reminder for the check-in. Pegasus app which I used to check-in prior airport arrival wasn't working properly, so that I could only check-in for my connecting flight.
At the airport itself, I had to pay for 2kg excess luggage (I already payed for 30kg excess luggage in advance) whereas the majority of people on the plane had carry-ons (even more than 1 per person) which were evidently way to heavy and didn't have to pay in addition + could keep them in the cabine. This resulted in too many hand luggage in the plane so that the flight attendants had a very hard time to make storage in the overhead bin compartments. This resulted in a delay of 1 hour.
Also, I would expect for a duration such as Dubai-Istanbul or Istanbul-Basel to be offered a small snack which, obviously as a low-fare airline, wasn't the case with Pegasus. Overall experience was therefore very poor and I'll try to avoid flying with Pegasus in the future wherever possible, as also, on top of everything above, the cost-benefit ratio was completely irrational (too expensive for the serivce they offered).",9,"2017",2

In mentioned flight my seat was very dirty with melted chocolate parts (I hope...) and there was a bad smell

Bad weather, missing slots, the reason are many but is a constant irritant for the unhappy travellers as they worry if they will reach their next flight. Personally, I was certain that I would miss my corresponding flight to Ercan, North Cyprus as we were late once again, but as it turned out, the flight to Ercan was also delayed by 1 hour and 20 minutes.

inconvenient flight times - gate numbers charge at last minute and you need to keep an eye on the screen and avoid the gate number on your boarding pass

all in flight drink and food is extra - seating is not comfortable and customer service is poor.

my connecting flight in istanbul was stressful as the connection due was extremely long and took over 1 hour to go through security and there was no organisation.

gate number was changed again at last minute and all gates are miles apart and the furtherest away, had to go through security at the gate again just before departure

over all this is the worst airline i have used, with extra baggage charges for international flights - extra charges for meals and gates locations far away and change at last minute - poor and unhelpful customer service - uncomfortable seats

i would rather pay more money with other airlines and not worry about last minute gate changes and extra in flight charges or extra baggage charges

Add to this that any water you have bought in Ercan after security has to be thrown away is unacceptable either.
The final straw this time is, however, the fact that two of our bags were damaged in transit and after finding no-one at the Pegasus desk in Ercan we went to Istanbul Handling who took photos, gave us a weblink to Pegasus and said to send photos only off a desktop PC. We duly did this on our return only to be told we didn't have the correct form and it should have been sent within 7days. None of this was explained to us at the time and this airline is not budging.

They are a low-cost carrier and as such it is no-frills travel. I've had many pleasant trips with them, and ... a couple of less than happy ones. On a flight from Istanbul to Northern Cyprus my luggage was damaged and they reneged on re-reimbursement. On a separate flight from Bahrain to Istanbul there was a five hour delay (the ticketing systems computer went down - I don't know if the fault lay with the airline or the Bahrainis) but no apologies, no nuthin' (!). All that said, I will book with them again. Because on yet one other occasion, I was set to go with my wife on a vacation and I became suddenly very ill. I needed emergency surgery. The airline was very understanding and generously re-imbursed all costs even though I only contacted them perhaps a week after missing the flight.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Terrible experience each & every time!","Always delayed, always dirty seats and traytables and always trash everywhere. The aircrafts leave the gate in order not to classified as delayed but instead waits somewhere on its way to the runway up to 2 hours!

"Pegasus-Airlines","Likeliness to recommend should be zero","Bad services, rude personnel, passenger mistreating , delayed departure. I was forced to pay 20 euros for a 4 kilo difference in cabin luggage (IATA norm is 12 kilos but these crooks charge from 8 kilos onwards), even though I had paid my excess online and showed the receipt to the rude individual claiming to be a supervisor. A shame of airline. Not worth a penny.",9,"2017",1

But us my family not even for 75% off. Save your time, stress and money.",9,"2017",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Flight to Sabiha Gokcen","Good flight although an hour late but this was due to a problem in Amsterdam and not the airline.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Value for money","For 3 of 4 our flights (Lviv-Istanbul-Dalaman / Dalaman-Istanbul-Lviv) the gate was changed right before boarding time brining obvious inconvenience to all passengers. Leg room in the planes is quite small, no food or drinks are provided. To their credit when one of our flight was delayed for over an hour they provided us with water and croissants.",8,"2017",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","First Flight with Pegasus","The staff was nice, we land on time but beforehand there was a delay at the airport but no one gave information. I think the problem is because of the staff in Antalya Airport.The airplane was new and comfortable which is important for me. For food and drink you have to pay. This flights are cheap but anyway with a little price increase they can manage the food service for free.",8,"2017",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Most horrible travel experience with this airline","Horrible! Never use Pegasus! We were delayed on our connecting flight and reached the next airport before the flight took off- no one from the company was willing to help us or delay the flight for us to reach the next airplane, although the delay was their fault in the first place.

The staff in sabiha airport are so rude, not willing to help, and not cooperative at all.

To top it off, the next available flight was after 24 hrs, they were not willing to try to book us on other flights- we missed very important meetings and work obligations.

The next day flight got delayed 35 minutes!!!

In addition, our luggage was sent to dubai with the first day, although they assured us that it's on the plane 2 times. We had to wait all the luggage to get out on the belt, to figure out that our luggage is missing and then go to baggage claim which told us that our luggage is already in dubai from the previous day.

So many mistakes, delays, unprofessionalism.

We reached our destination more than 28 hrs later- not once we heard a word of apology or any sympathy from any employee....",8,"2017",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","unfair","As we checked in at the Pegasus counter in Copenhagen Airport and we deliver our luggage, they also checked the hand bags and gave us tags to put on them which means that the hand bags allowed to carry on with us to the cabin, unfortunately at the boarding gate in Istanbul where we had to wait for another airplane to continue our flight to Lebanon, an employee from Pegasus airlines had a portable weight scale and started weighting the bags again and i told him that we had tags on them which means permitted to carry on, he said no the handbag was over weighted we got confuse, how to deal with them, but finally after a light scrimmage he allowed us. And still i don't understand this confusion between the employees.",8,"2017",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","primitive service","Absolutely not organized staff,when they picked us up from the bldg to the airplane by bus and we arrived, people got out from the bus and went to the plane, where front and rear doors where opened and passengers climbed up the stairs without any guidance, so some people who had front seats climbed up from back doors and who had rear seats climbed up the stairs from the front doors, so they all faced each other inside the corridor and where confused to find their way to their seats. the airplane hasn't any screen neither personal (on the seat) nor one common for several rows. Seats are not capable to adjust. Food in the airplane isn't free even though you have to pay for water, and if you don't have minor units of currency then a steward will hold the banknote and starts walking back and forth for asking if someone has exchange.",8,"2017",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","We were double charged for luggage by Pegasus, Sabiha Gökçen Office. We almost missed the flight because of them.","ur flight was Glasgow-Amsterdam/Amsterdam-Istanbul SAV. Istanbul-Amsterdam/Amsterdam-Glasgow. It was a joint flight with KLM and Pegasus. KLM side was excellent. I had paid for the round trip luggage to KLM at Glasgow airport at the start of the trip. Pegasus airlines did not want to accept the receipt I had from KLM claiming that it was not recorded in the system. Apparently, a lot of people had the same problem. So I was told by one KLM steward in Amsterdam. The cabin experience was great in all flights. Everyone was very polite and helpful.",8,"2017",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst and current airline ever","Boarded the flight from Istanbul.After checking and when 10 minutes left for departure a rude member of staff asked for a bribe of £84 Euros I was travelling with my wife and 4 kids. I asked for a receipt and she said by the time she got me a receipt I would miss my flight and would have to rebook the flights. This should all be captured on CCTV at the airport.
I got on the flight at 11.05 and as were late on due to being held back was told by cabin crew to leave the luggage at the front of the cabin and they would transfer it to Manchester. I became a bit susoicious and nothing was trackable in either Amsterdam by either Pegasus(operator) or KLM (point of orginal booking). Their customer services are terrible. I would never fly with Pegasus. This is the worst flight experience I have ever had in my life. Please pay more and use a reputable airline as they dont even acknolowde you or smile at you. I have had better experiences in a third world country.",8,"2017",1

"Pegasus-Airlines","Miss Tracy Fonseca","The aircraft was dirty and inflight meals had to be preordered which we were never told. We were delayed leaving by over an hour yet they rushed us to the departure lounge when there was an over the hour delay which made it difficult for us with a young child. Have never ever had such a big problem checking in online it's the most confusing airline website I've ever used and to make it even worse they only allow check in 24 hours before and on top of that you have to print it out you cannot display it on your phone like you can with most other airlines this made things an absolute nightmare for us when we tried to print our ticket 24 hours before flying in turkey pc was in Turkish ended up having to call last minute which costed more money for us. Do not book this airline it's not worth the hassle",8,"2017",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","another budget airline, dont expect service but, I feel safe...","I fly quite often on Pegasus and generally Im happy with service. Well, as much service of a budget airlines could give..
Most importantly, yes seats are tight etc but, I feel safe flying with Pegasus. Usually half a price compare to other major airlines.
Delays could happen in any airlines in Europe flights so Im passing complaining on that. But, in general not too many delays.
Sure, you pay for your food and drinks....
Their app is good too but, lately has been double charging even they return the amount immadiatly but, they should fix the problem asap...",8,"2017",4

"Pegasus-Airlines","Much the same as any other budget airline","TBH there is very little to choose between any budget airline you fly with - its cattle class, limited legroom, no in-flight meals, lengthy check-in queues if you are taking hold luggage, the usual delays at both arrival & departure airports. You cannot say the service is either good or bad as from my experience all budget airlines are the same and there was nothing memorable with this particular airline either good or bad.",8,"2017",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Low cost flying","due to the flight being a short one the flight is good, all the extras you need to pay for upfront or on the plane, but not really necessary due to a short trip, the online booking is great as you can prebook extra luggage and sports equipment at lower costs and reduces your check in booking without running around to pay for the extras",8,"2017",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Totally unexpected","Having been discouraged to use Pegasus in the past I decided to bite the bullet and book them for an unexpected visit to Turkey.
Booking was easy from the app provided the ""English"" box was ticked. I've docked a star because it wasn't clear as to when you could book in on line pre flight. Unless it has changed it is 10 hours before.
The cost of the flight and the inclusive add ons were very reasonable. Cheaper than I've flown to Turkey in the past!
Airport was easy both going out and departure. The flight left on time and the food wasn't spectacular but it was good. The service was first class on this trip.",8,"2017",4

"Pegasus-Airlines","Budget Airline - you get what you pay for","Booked though an agent, this is a 'no frills' airline & you get what you pay for which is a flight! In flight meal is extra but as we were flying through the night was not a problem. Alright seats are cramped & we had a half hour stop over at instanbul but overall the flight was fine & the staff are friendly. Would use again but really prefer to fly to Larnaca & get a taxi over the boarder.",8,"2017",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Not comfortable at all","Even though they renewed their planes, unfortunately the seats are less comfortable than before! They are really hard and give you lower back pain. Surprisingly no delays for the first time, but usually happens. But I believe this is usually due to the air traffic. Of course nothing is free, not even a single bottle of water. I think the international flights can at least offer a bottle of water for free.",8,"2017",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Terrible","The flight from Bishkek to Istanbul got late. We missed our connection to Tel Aviv. We were placed at hotel with no vacant rooms and spent all night in hotel lobby. When we wrote complain to Pegasus, they just apologized without proposing any compensation.",8,"2017",1

When I was returning from Antalya I also had an issue at the lounge ..Some people have no business working at customer care ..All in all I appreciate the airline",8,"2017",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","cheap airlines - prices online are ok","airlines are ok, except they left one bag at Istanbul (connection) and when i asked the employee at Charleroi airport about it she told me that it will delivered to my address in Brussels after 7 days!!!!!",8,"2017",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst service & worst employee","We went for a relaxation trip to Istanbul, when we arrived to the airport we stayed around 4 hours to know after that our luggage were not in! After several argument with the responsible person they promised to send us the luggage to the hotel the day after.
Our trip was over without getting them.
They have unprofessional employees and management who just don't care and they treat you disrespectfuly.
They ruin our vacation they we had to buy clothe and everything during our stay!",8,"2017",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Alright","The airports are nightmare in Istanbul especially right before the 'bayram' holidays. Either avoid that period or be at the airport 3 hours in advance especially when traveling with an infant. Everything went well luckily and made it to the flight. Even though I bought my seat with and extra leg room because I was travelling with an infant, the person at the counter almost changed my seat at the counter because she claimed that it was an exit and I am not allowed to sit there. Luckily the flight was full so she could not just change my seat and put me somewhere that I do not want to sit. I was just lucky. I got on the plane and it was of course not an exit!! How otherwise would the system allow me to buy it? Pegasus offers cheap flights, and you pay for everything, it is always very congested at the counter and you wait in lines. If you do not mind that it is an OK company I think.",8,"2017",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Surprising after seeing reviews","After reading the horror stories on here about this airline it was with trepidation we boarded. The flight left on time, landed on time, a representative was on hand in Istanbul to direct us to the next flight which again took off and landed on time.

Same coming back. Arrived back in the UK on time.
So apart from slightly cramped seats and not particularly nice hostesses I can not complain. It is budget. You get what you pay for and in this case they were fine.

No complaints. But why does Stanstead take 2 hours to get out of after you land.
Please someone sort this huge mess. Even Gatwick is quicker.

Used to be one of the best. Now probably the worst.",8,"2017",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Great airline to travel to Turkey","Good value for money and service, convinient connections via Ankara. Baggage pre-order only 9 usd one way, that is very good. And not too strict control on gate)",8,"2017",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","No longer worth using them","You now have to get off the flight, go through security and get back on another plane! Before we could stay on the flight for 45 mins and then take off again.

Many friends have missed connecting flight, had to wait 4 hours to get the next one, and we have to pick them up at silly o'clock in the morning.

We are all flying to Larnaca now short pleasant flight and 1 1/2 hits taxi to Lapta. So much less tiring and stressful.

Shortsighted especially as Ercan is being expanded! So annoying",8,"2017",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Staff showed contempt on travelers","It was terrible trip at all rates. First of all trip was delayed for one hour and forty seven minutes. During this period they announce for the delay two times without serving anything, at least cup of water for the kids in the shuttle. They brought a cup of water to an English passenger how shouted on them because of the delay while all other passenger get nothing. Considering of uncomfortable chairs which has fixed back for a trip over than four hours and thirty minutes with a very thin layer of foam or sponge either at sitting or at the back, comparing chairs in internal lines or European lines is far away better at least it is regular chairs for long trips. The ever worst thing came later after departing staff start selling food and beverages, the unbelievable behavior is once any customer purchased anything and give them his credit card they start staring on the card as if it came from Mars or anywhere else in the space as they are not familiar with this kind of cards then staff started pretending that they are trying to use this strange card but it didn’t work to push on customer to pay cash. So the poor fellow will pay either by Euro or By Us dollar, the act was if he paid by Euro they will tell him that they don’t have change in Euro so they will payback his amount by Us dollar but according to a very high rate of currency changing, and so they did if the costumer paid by US dollar. Even it is announced that they accept credit cards on board. Also when staff started paying back they pretend that they are collecting the money from other colleagues then they told the customer sorry we don’t have the rest two dollars. During all these process of selling most of the staff have resentful face looks like the costumer should thank them for they behave modesty and serving him. This act is notable and repeated in all routes but is much rude in Doha Istanbul rout. Personally I paid for my daughter’s cheese sandwich 13 Euro which is officially priced 8 Euros in the list.",8,"2017",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Lost baggage and bad service","First time flying with Pegasus and we arrived to Istanbul without our baggage. The staff knew nothing about where they might be we stayed in airport for 3 hours while they were searching and making us fill reports. they promised to deliver them to our hotel the next day, but only sent them after 4 days and not all of them!! we had to take a ride to the airport the fifth day to get the rest. And all this time they never answered their hot lines in Istanbul Airport to give us any info about our bags!
From my side, I'm never traveling with them again. But i don't want to be unfair, their captains are good and the airplanes feel safe but not comfortable at all so I would just recommend it for those who are on a tight budget, don;t care about food or entertainment and with a flight that only takes an hour or so..",8,"2017",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","old plane, rude staff","on both ways, the crew were rude, impolite and did not listen to any question. their favorite answer is no, we cannot, even before hearing the full question.

the planes are old and i strongly suggest that they add TV screens.
the food selection is also poor.

while on a connection flight, they don't give clear indication on where to go for transfer. the flight was delayed and it was a struggle to catch the other flight. no one on the ground to guide all travelers or to secure fast track for the passengers. we had to fight our way to passport control and run to board the other flight.
at the airport, there is no division between domestic flights and international: the queue lines were horrific, aggressive people, no proper cooling. very badly organized.",8,"2017",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Flights often got delayed.","Flight schedule was a mess. Sometimes we had to wait in the lobby after midnight, sometimes an hour on the plane itself. Luckily there was no problem with the transfer between flights because it was always late and there was a huge time interval between them. However, with kids, these delays were a real pain in the ***.",8,"2017",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Friendly and efficient","A very pleasant experience.
Really impressed with their inflight menu and presentation.
Flight crew looked great and were attentive.",8,"2017",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst airline and worst airport experience!","I would like to tell you the terrible experience I had with this airline and inside its hub airport, Sabiha Gocken. It is long but please bear with me.

The story begins when we arrived at Sabiha Gocken (ISG) from Sarajevo airport (SJJ) for a one hour transit before heading to our final destination, Bahrain (BAH).

While we were going through the security checkpoint we were stopped by the costumes officers to inspect the content of my friend's bag. They identified a souvenir that was considered suspicious to them. We really did not mind taking it as our priority was catching our flight but they insisted that we get escorted to their supervisor in the upper floor so they can get the final decision.

After we arrived the supervisor inspected it, took photos of my friend's passport and boarding pass and finally said that they will have to confiscate it!

The whole process took around 30 mins.

So after finishing we rushed to our gate (307 A) to wait for the boarding. We arrived and people were still queuing up in front of the gate. We have heard only one announcement for our flight and then no further announcements were given. We also noticed that several other Pegasus flights boarding at the same time were being frequently announced which was weird for us. Eventually, we headed to the gate to board just before the gate closing timing and then came the shock. The gate was closed!

We tried to speak to one of Pegasus personnel and he advised that he cannot do anything to us. There was no ""final call"" announcement or any announcement with our names which is a normal procedure in all airports and with all airlines.

We were directed to go upstairs and wait for someone from Pegasus to advise us on the next steps. We went upstairs near the costumes office and waited there for more than two hours without anyone coming or explaining what needs to be done. There was one phone where no one was picking up and when they did not provide any useful information and just asked us to keep waiting.

After that, someone from Pegasus came and advised us that we should go downstairs to Pegasus transit office so they can look into the issue. We went down and after several discussions with the customs officers that allowed us to enter the area.

The transit office personnel asked us about what happened so we explained the whole matter. They then advised that we should go up again near the customs office and wait for another Pegasus employee to arrange for the luggage and booking of our next flight. So we went up again and waited for one more hour. Then after waiting with no one coming or calling we went down again to the same person who advised that we should have waited there and that he was calling someone to come to us. After that he discussed with his colleague and gave us a new instruction; we should head to the passport control counters to exit the airport, pick up our luggage and schedule the next flight.

As we were transiting through Turkey we did not have any visa. So after suffering in the long queue for 3-4 hours we were advised to contact Pegasus to arrange for our eVisa so we can exit the airport.

We were searching for any Pegasus employee in the area and it was around 2:00 AM and no one was there! Then by coincidence we opened one door and found a Pegasus employee. He immediately asked us to step out of the office and came outside, we explained to him the whole thing and then he advised that we should apply for an eVisa by going again to the upper floor, buying Internet, and applying for the visa, although he had a PC and Internet access where he could easily have assisted us being that we are supposedly a ""Valued Customer""!

After that, we headed upstairs, bought the Internet subscription, and applied for the eVisa and then came back. The customs officers denied us again from entering until someone from Pegasus comes. So we waited for 15 minutes until we saw someone and they allowed us to enter.

Then we headed to the passport control, entered the luggage area and went to Pegasus Baggage office. We asked them that we wanted to take our luggage and they directed us to Carousel 3. When our bags arrived, my friend's bag was severely damaged to the point that he could not move it.

So we took a trolley and headed outside. We went to Pegasus ticket office to book our next flight and here was the surprise: No one was there! Although there was an employee in another airline office just opposite of it. So we decided that we are fed up with Pegasus with their lack of professionalism, treatment and bad service. We booked our return flight on the other airline and booked the Airport Hotel to stay there as our flight was at 09:35 PM.

i filed a complaint with Pegasus and their only response was to justify the gate closing and did not respond to any points related to the terrible customer service experience we had where we were stranded i the airport for more than 7 hours without offering us the slightest level of support to rebook our flight which is something that happens everyday in any airline and with no hassle.",8,"2017",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Budget airlines - you get what you pay for","You get what you pay for. The airline gets you there but it is super low budget. Their computer system to check-in must be absolutely archaic; extremely slow. It should never take that long to check in a plane full of passengers. We even paid extra for free luggage and a free meal. They are quite literal -- yes, you get a free meal but the beverage will cost you. (Should've read the fine print!) Lesson learned -- always add an extra hour for Pegasus' slowness if you want to depart on your flight on time. It has been known that they have left passengers behind because they failed to factor in the airline's slower than snail pass to process its passengers.",8,"2017",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Stay away from this airline.","Always delayed flights.. umcomfortable seating. Not enough leg room for even people who are short enough like me... You pay for water even when they are late and made you wait at the gate for an hour. Prices are too high for what you get.",8,"2017",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Great first experience. Excellent value for money.","This was my first travel with Peagus and it was indeed amazing experience. I booked in advance and it was very economical.

Overall, it was a real value for money.",8,"2017",5

"Pegasus-Airlines","Frequent flyer- never a bad experience","Having moved to Turkey, I've flown via Pegasus for a number of domestic flights. Never had a bad experience.

3: The police stops an old lady in customs with your passport ... ahh but to late the flight is gooooooooooneeeee!! (not a call or an e-email even though i could have got the flight on time)

"Pegasus-Airlines","INCOMPETENT Lost Luggage both ways","We flew from Manchester to Dalaman via Amsterdam and Istanbul and the exact same on the return journey.

Outbound our luggage was lost, found in Istanbul as it had not been our flight to Dalaman, so it was finally found and received 2 days into the holiday. Inconvenient and a hassle when dealing with the situation as no information was given what was happening and the airport rep spoke poor English.

Homeward bound we were initially told our cases would only go to Amsterdam and then we would have to collect and then check back in for our last flight. Our cases were 1 kilo over for 2 cases combined, fair enough we were over but not ridiculously. The woman at the counter gave no option to take anything out and was very strict in insisting we pay. She could not or WOULD not tell us a price. We had a large hand luggage and would have either put this through as an extra case or taken 1 kilo out of and put it in here.

We had to go to a service desk who were unhelpful and again wouldn't discuss price. The system was down and we waited over half an hour whilst watching everyone else check in. We were anxious that we would either not get seats together or not even make the flight as we were not allowed to check in until we had paid. Eventually we were told it would cost 70 Euros for 1 kilo, SEVENTY! Or we could pay the same price for another whole case. The whole thing was ridiculous. We asked why we couldn't take a kilo out and put in hand luggage to be told we could, with a very surly face displaying the sheer disappointment of not getting some extra cash.

So off we went to get a kilo out of our case that the woman at check in had kept to one side to see she had put them through already! We had to wait for them to be retrieved from the depths of the airport, halfway to being put on the plane despite us not even being checked in and on the way to the flight ourselves! Another half an hour later...

The miserable check in woman called us over and gave us knew luggage stickers saying our cases were now being transferred all the way to our final destination of Manchester, not Amsterdam and how this was better for us. Yes that's great. Suddenly we didn't need to pay, again great. She sent us on our way and we had to ask to be checked in, unknowing that she had actually already done this and forgot to give us our boarding cards!

The best thing about all of this ridiculous scenario was that our cases never ended up in Manchester. They were taken off and stuck in Amsterdam, so here we are sat at home with lost luggage once again!

We have traveled all over the world and NEVER experienced lost luggage and then double whammy, twice with the same airline on the same holiday. Absolute joke.

In addition, there is no in flight entertainment, even on a 4 hour flight. There are no free meals, snacks or drinks. Leg room is poor, seating uncomfortable and the plane was not clean. The staff are unfriendly on the flight also.

NEVER USE.",8,"2017",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst travel experience","Booked 4 flights all got delayed for at least 40 min with no information provided, the service was terrible, bought some water on the flight, and they didnt give change back.. and went on with no explanation, but when i called out for the change, they said not to have enough but would give it in another currency.. which means they would have kept it havent I signaled it!
Also, when waiting at the gate, staff are rude, snob you when asking when are we finally boarding.
There is a serious work to do on English since the majority wouldnt even try to help or give information pretexting not to understand your need.
If you dont speak Turkish, dont fly with Pegasus",8,"2017",1

"Pegasus-Airlines","Very bad service and unhelpful staff","I will not use this airline again, worse experience ever and staff are very unhelpful. We was delayed for 5 hours at Stansted Airport with no explanation as to why and further delays in Turkey for up to 9 hours to board our connection flight to Cyprus. Passengers were told by Pegasus staff to buy a Visa at passport control for £20 then they will refund it by emailing pegasus direct which I did but pegasus customer relations are refusing to refund the money and ignoring many of my emails. They also lost a number of suitcases including mine and when I eventually received my suitcase the next day it was damaged. They have caused me so much stress trying to locate my suitcase I didn't have a great holiday at the start. They even made me travel by taxi to the airport to collect my suitcase which cost £90 and the airline are refusing to cover this cost though it was their fault. Never again am I going to fly with this airline, I will use Turkish Airlines instead.",8,"2017",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","No frills, poor service and terrible food","The only reason I pick this airline over THY is the destination airport in IST that is more convenient for me. If that wasn’t the case, I would never consider even if it comes out slightly cheaper, the overall experience is far superior with THY.",8,"2017",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Poor Customer Service, Scam","We booked a flight and had to postpone to another date. Unfortunately, customer service was a pain to deal with. Unhelpful, and flat out rude throughout the entire process.

We ended up cancelling our flight and foregoing 600$ (more than half of the ticket price) because of their dodgy terms and conditions.

A below average flight that tricks people using low fares for the worst airline customer service you can imagine.",7,"2017",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Excellet as ever","I always use pegasus airlines whenever I travel to Turkey. I found them excellent as ever and have used them around 15 times without ever having a problem. They provide a wide range of services, which are clearly explained over the internet when booking. I really like that you can check the prices and times of flights before booking around the dates you want so you can choose the cheapest price. For what I pay for the flights I always find them such value for money and the staff are always polite and helpful. I also like the fact that compared to other airlines Peasus privode more hand and luggage allowance. I will continue to use Peasus and would recommend them to others.",7,"2017",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Do not recommend flying with this airline!","Highly recommend that you avoid this airline unless you want a headache and unnecessary stress throughout your holiday. They are not only negligent but don't seem to care about the stress caused to customers. Lost luggage was not handled well and even after the trip they are being uncooperative and denying any real responsibility. No real updates were provided so we just had to literally wait until the suitcase was found. The most stressful experience ever.",7,"2017",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Delay without notice","Our flight time was 13 and we checked flight information before going to the Sabiha airport. When we arrived saw that the flight was delayed by about 5 hours. We had a short time to visit Antalya and flight delay caused we lost one full afternoon.
Except for this, we had a good flight. We determined the seat when buying tickets, and there was no problem with this.",7,"2017",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Be Cautious in Sabiha Airport","Airlines itself is an average low coast and can be considered for short flights with and for those traveling with hand luggage only as for the check in baggage you have to pay obviously extra.
For those traveling from Sabiha Airport it is highly recommended to arrive to the airport at least 3 hours prior your flight since the check in procedure is very slow. Consider self check in especially when traveling with hand luggage only to avoid 2 hours waiting in check in counter.",7,"2017",3

"Pegasus-Airlines","They do what they want even you've pre book your seat","We pre booked our seat and paid a lot for the extra leg room for return, when try to book in at the airport, they have given away our seat, and put us in any where they have the spare seat, when complain about the seats, they just said to sort it out when we get on the plane, once on the plane , they just said it wasn't their problems, took me a long time to try to get my money back.",7,"2017",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst Airline ever","Bad experience with this airline incompetence and rude. Missed our transfer flight because the airline staff would not assist to let us pass through passport control quickly, and even though I told them that will miss our plane if we waited in line, however they insisted that there is time to catch the transfer plane، eventually guess what ! there was no time ! we had to wait 9 hours for next flight, no compensation what so ever was provided like hotel or lounge. Airline insisted that its not there fault. The airplane sucks and hot.",7,"2017",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Some planes have seats that do not recline at all","We flew from Dubai to Athens with a changeover in Instanbul. On the way out - in the five hour flight to Istanbul the entire plane had seats that did not recline! This was the first time we had experienced this - even in a budget airline! The Istanbul to Athens leg had reclining seats.
On the way back again the Athens to Istanbul route had seats with no recline , but the Istanbul to Dubai leg had recline.

Apart from the seats I would say that the service was good - the staff were friendly and helpful and all four of our flights were on time. Our baggage was handled fine - nothing lost and we had pre-ordered sandwiches which were pretty good. I would have rated them higher but for the issue of non-reclining seats - which makes a longer flight very uncomfortable.",7,"2017",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Cheap fare, value for money.","Got super cheap tickets for round trip flights from Istanbul to Izmir, for a trip to Ephesus.
The seats are good for short haul flights, wouldn't consider for long journeys. On time arrival, on both the legs of the journey.",7,"2017",3

In additional to the above, the landing from Istanbul to Madrid was terrible, the plane was bumping.You can buy a meal or drinks in the flight. The staff were friendly.",7,"2017",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Never ever fly with this airline!!!!!","Flying from London Stansted airport to Ercan Northern Cyprus via Istanbul..flight number.PC1932
13/07/2017 flight 23.45 left stansted over night flight to Istanbul for connection flight to Ercan Cyprus.
Arrived at Istanbul sabiha airport at around 5.30 am local time. No officials from Pegasus to direct transit passengers to correct point for transfers, I ended up at wrong point where an official of the airport referred to the passengers as 'lan' what are you doing waiting so far away from the line...
Soon discovered I was not at correct point and managed to find transit passengers direction signs.. followed signs for lounge for Ercan passengers after a long walk sat down when someone said the departure lounge has changed to which everyone started to walk to.
After sitting at the new lounge an official of Pegasus made an announcement that the lounge has been changed yet again to the first lounge.Disappointedly we all started to walk again to the new lounge once more where no official was present, although we could clearly see buses have arrived to transport us onto the plane no staff from Pegasus are present.we all sat down as we are now all tired as it's bad enough traveling on a night flight. Eventually after an hour waiting an announcement is made that the flight to Ercan has now been delayed a further one hour..all of the time there has not been any apology of any sort for all our inconveniences.
Never ever will I fly with Pegasus anywhere in the world and I will always actively encourage others not to as well!!!!!
Don't do it!!!!!",7,"2017",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Avoid at all costs!","This airline is embarrassing! Dirty, and we felt as though the maintenance crew forgot to tighten the last screw during take-off and landing. We boarded 45 minutes late and sat on the tarmac for another hour . When finally airborne, we were charged 5 euro for a 250 ml water bottle. To top it off, the delay resulted in us missing our next flight (to Toronto) and we had to book for the next day out. Flight charges: $600 x 2; hotel fee: 510 euro= total $1700 for the ridiculous delay by Pegasus. Next time we will fly Turkish Airlines!",7,"2017",1

"Pegasus-Airlines","Only Flight","Pegasus provides only flight to passangers. You can find cheaper tickets on the company's own website. Be very careful during your purchasing period on the company's website. Because at the end it costs more than first step because of tax, seat, meal, luggage additions. Be very careful about luggage weight. Otherwise you will pay extra for your luggages. For example in some flights you have no luggage except 8 kg of hand baggage. You should purchase water and any other meals and drinks in the plane. Most of the flights are on time and everything is in good order. Seats are very narrow. Host and hostesses are well educated are normal. Online checkin is benefit for this company.",7,"2017",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","14 hour delay - what a joke!!","If you want a cheap flight to Northern Cyprus do not use Pegasus airlines. Having endured a 14 hour delay at Stansted with very little communication from the Airline other than the Captain was 'out of hours' the whole experience was something we would not wish to repeat. Pegasus have not responded to any request for compensation which under EU rules should have been forthcoming. I certainly would not recommend them or use them again.",7,"2017",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Rubbish customer services","Worse on-line check-in ever for transfer flights. Even though I typed in the reservation no. I was only given the option to check-in one of the flights. When I complaint, the response totally ignored my complaint and said there is nothing wrong with their system. Even though I have responded back, they are still ignoring my complaint - almost as though the emails are written by robots! I've also booked flights with them to Capadoccia one of which they cancelled already, no reason given.",7,"2017",1

1- Flight was on time with no delay.
2- All flight attendant were kind and helpful. I must say one of them, was the kindest FA I have ever seen.
3-Three of FAs were Persian speaking and important announcement was released also in Persian, in addition to Turkish and English.
4-Legrooms were truly OK.
5- Buy on Board was OK and not too much expensive.",7,"2017",4

"Pegasus-Airlines","Not the worst but a candidate","Pegasus is known as the one of the worst airline in Turkey and in the world. Lots of delays, no customer service, unhelpful staff. The only good thing about them are the flight crew but they deserve a better airline. And of course they are low budget, which makes them more attractive but still, we don't need to be treated like this just because we fly low budget.",7,"2017",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Good","Very good on time plenty of legroom good service crew very pleasant and helpful no complaints will travel with then again",7,"2017",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Good service at a good price","A great airline. For us expats they are by far the cheapest way of getting back to the U.K. if needed. Okay, you have to go via Istanbul but that is not really a problem. I particularly like the three levels of pricing, from the basic walk on with just hand luggage, or with 20kg, or with a meal as well. All the usual upgrades are available if you want them, extra leg room, so on and so forth. The online check in system is great and a big time saver. All in all I have used this airline many times over the last few years and have never had a problem. You can of course use Turkish airlines which are also very good but also a lot more expensive.",7,"2017",4

to get good seats you need to pay very much, making it similar to high budget airlines.",7,"2017",1

"Pegasus-Airlines","Cheaper to fly but expensive if you need anything","Nothing is included, the seats are narrow and close to each other ( it is like sitting in a minibus), the price is low, the planes are new, pilots are good ( you dont even feel the touch down)...Not bad if you are flying less than 2 hours ( Domestic flights). More than 4 hours, or overseas? Fly with Turkish Airlines.",6,"2017",3

"Pegasus-Airlines","Not comfortable","The supposedly new planes for Pegasus are actually way less comfortable than the previous ones. The knee space is not enough and the seats are not comfortable at all. The flight to Barcelona had only one bathroom working; 2 were broken! Even the staff was shocked about this. The takeoff and landing were good though, smooth enough; timing was surprisingly good. No in-flight entertainment, not even music or common screen.",6,"2017",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst airlines ever!","I had to domestic flight in Turkey with that company I don't know if ever worse another company beside Pegasus world wide..( include domestic Asia companies )
Terrible service, terrible attitude of workers, terrible price policy, looks like cheap ticket but at the end much much more expensive than THY or the other companies...Even the normal phone customer service is triple time more expensive than the basic price.. And just for to talk on the phone you have to wait at least 10 or 15 min. waiting list.. While you are waiting already you are paying like another regular ticket price... I don't know how they are cheating the people like that ? With whom I ever talk about Pegasus airlines everybody has a big complaining... So better to have to share this as much as possible with the people...",6,"2017",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Pleasantly Surprised","I booked with Pegasus to return from Bahrain back to the UK. I had seen some fairly negative reviews but as they were the cheapest I decided to take a chance.

The check in was quick at Bahrain and they sent my hold bag onwards to Stansted meaning as I had to transfer at Istanbul I didn't need to collect my bag. The flight wasn't fully booked meaning the middle seat was free on most rows. The flight to Istanbul from Bahrain had plenty of leg room, I am over 6ft and didn't feel cramped. The flight also landed ahead of schedule. All in all a good first leg.

From Istanbul the Pegasus staff were helpful when I double checked my hold back would be sent on. The flight again from Istanbul to Stansted wasn't full and this time there was even more leg room. The flight again landed ahead of schedule.

The flights were cheap and did not include food or drink. I always buy a bottle of water after security checks and take my own food so this wasn't an issue for me.

I will fly with Pegasus again, no frills, decent planes, efficient and easy to get from A to B.",6,"2017",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","pleasant flight to Barcelona","The flight from Tel Aviv to Barcelona through istanbul was pleasant and cheep. Take offs and landings as scheduled. Stay in Istanbul was short enough. Overall, worth the saving. Note, no free food or water during these short flights",6,"2017",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Narrow but cheap","If you are looking for relaxed and comfortable flight with lots of space and good food & beverage this airline is definitely not for you.
For myself I always fly with Pegasus Airlines because they offer cheap tickets all around Europe, their air crafts are new, crew is gentle and for a backpack traveler they are amazing.",6,"2017",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","travel without your legs !!","the international flights of Pegasus are awful although the domestic flight from istanbul to izmir was ok. there isn't any space for legroom , they might have thought passengers don't have leg ! if you are tall you might have the terrible experience with this airline specially on a long flights.",6,"2017",2

"Pegasus-Airlines","Watch out their layovers!","I took a flight of this company from Moscow to Antalya through Istanbul (SAW).
I cannot say anything bad either about service or cleanliness at board but I'd like to warn all future passengers about Pegasus' layovers. Mine was just 1 hour 25 minutes and the point is not baggage which was automatically taken to my connected flight. No. I am talking about short layovers to pass the passport control in Sabiha Gokcen Airport (SAW) where you know there are very very long lines!
Oh my God! The Pegasus' clerk a guy at the desk there told me pretty calmly that I should stay in line and everything will be OK but I was pretty nervous and as I saw later it wasn't in vain. The officer at the passport control said a couple of ""gentle"" words about Pegasus too...
I stood in line about 1 hour and then was running all over duty free zone to my gate and electronic board showed me: ""LAST CALL... LAST CALL...""
Well I caught my aircraft at price of millions of my neural cells and pretty nasty feeling seeing gloomy dissatisfied faces of others in that plane :)

1 month later when I was looking for my back trip I found one affordable flight with Pegasus airlines. Through Istanbul. With a layover time 1 hour 5 minutes :) What do you think I did? I didn't buy it having preferred another company with an
intelligible layover time.

Be careful.",6,"2017",4

"Pegasus-Airlines","a decent service for a good price","it is a budget no on board food airline. Service is good and flight leave on time.

However, price for service received is a good deal.",6,"2017",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Unhelpful","Okie here it goes, my father was denied boarding because of issue with his e-visa which is understandable. However, bizarrely my Mum and lil sister's passport was returned too. They both had U.K passport.
For some reason member of the staff did not inform them that they can travel on the scheduled flight and my father can follow them later on.

After a long time my mother and sister challenged and they were issued boarding pass however, they weren't escorted to the flight and subsequently missed the flight.

Member of staff did not offer alternative flight. They didn't even leave notes for their colleagues and my parents were left stranded at the airport for over 8 years.

In the end, staff attempted to find a place ti the last flight but it was full. They were simply told to raise it with the airline.

Simply pathetic.

Their initial flight was at mid day and they waited up to midnight simply to be told that they need to raise with their head office!

I won't recommend them unless you know your consumer rights pretty well.",6,"2017",2

"Pegasus-Airlines","poor service","I travel with Pegasus a couple of time, but my experience is really worst. We prefer to travel in the night, that's the reason why we have chosen this airline, but you never can get any sleep there. It's not a flight, it's a open market, where the sales associates are expert in maximizing there daily sales. Seating arrangement is really narrow, but that's what is expected from a economic airlines. The real problem in this airline is there non stop sealing, which gives no comfort to the passenger.

Suggestion: Avoid flying this airline if you have any other option.",6,"2017",2

"Pegasus-Airlines","Unexpected Pleasure","Having to organise an unexpected holiday cost was of the utmost importance. Looked at my usual Companies and then remembered that Pegasus flew to Dalaman. The flight was easy to book online, I had the choice of Gatwick or Stansted. Gatwick was the preferred choice. It was nice to find that there is just one overall charge to cover the extras of hold luggage, preferred seat and hot or cold food on both the outward and inward journey. This charge was cheaper than other Company charges for just hold luggage! The flight boarded quickly and left on time. The onboard staff were pleasant and talked to you. The ordered food was adequate for a short haul flight. The return journey was just as good. The only downside was no gin and tonic 😔 but there was beer and wine. Will certainly use them again.",6,"2017",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","pegasus much better than thompsons","flew with Pegasus very good airline to say it was basic far superior than Thompson's & yes you get exactly what is described and not what you should get as with Thompson. booked Dreamliner but never got it.

But they won't !!! They told me to wait until the passenger wakes up to bring it !!!!!

"Pegasus-Airlines","Not comfortable even when you buy the first row seat","The website is friendly and clear but once you do your booking the food option to buy is limited. The service is average and seats leg room is very limited not to mention the seats are not comfy at all. The flexibility to buy extra weight is a plus. In my case it has the advantage of flights from Kuwait to Sabiha airport as Turkish airline does not have daily flights to Sabiha and some times flights are only available to Ataturk airport only",6,"2017",3

I had to make so many phone calls and emails at the end they offered me 240 dollars!
Worth of my belongings in my baggages was more than £3000. They ignored my emails and never replied to my emails after that. I called them few times and the answer was you have to email us but they didn't reply to my emails. how helpful!

"Pegasus-Airlines","A sip of water on a 5 hour flight costs 1.5 Euros","OK, it is a low cost airline. It does get you from A to B but expect nothing else. Extremely irritating to me was on a late evening/early morning ""Red Eye"" flight I was really dehydrated. The crew secures themselves behind a drawn curtain upfront and avoids all possible passenger contact. So I knew I need to hydrate for health reasons. The head steward was seemingly agitated that I saw fit to draw open their curtain and ask for water. He loudly pointed out the he only provided H2O for 1.5 Euros, cash. If you had no Euros, then you could not have a drink of water, period!!! That to me is a new low in airline maltreatment of paying customers. Beware!",6,"2017",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","value for money","given the very cheap price of flights within Turkey, Pegasus is delivering value for money and there is nothing to complain. During my stay at SAW airport which is quite ok, I saw a lot of Pegasus aircraft movements and all were on time. Fleet is modern and well maintained, staff friendly and lack of food does not matter given the short flying times and the cheap price. Seat pitch is a bit small but still ok.",6,"2017",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","A level between the regular airline & low-cost airline","It is definitely better than other low-cost airlines where you almost pay to go to toilet. You have 20 kg plus 8 kg hand luggage included. You pay for your meals and coffee etc. Leg space is a little less than Turkish Airlines. In domestic flights leg space is a little less than international ones. As it goes to Sabiha Gokcen Airport at Istanbul, there are less delays. My advice is not to buy Flex tickets as they are too expensive to change. Fly on the days you buy, book as early as possible.",6,"2017",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Because of the price","Low cost with connection in Istanbul - the airplanes are ok but everything is very basic as you expect from low cost but my only big problem is why you can't get a cup of water???",6,"2017",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Poorly conducted staff","I recently flew with Pegasus and had a short stop over in Istanbul. Some of the Pegasus ground staff here who were ""assisting"" travellers at the transfer/connections desk were some of the most ill mannered I have ever encountered. Its worth mentioning I fly a lot.
Thankfully I personally didn't have any dealings with the male staff members in question, However, as I waited to be screened by security I was witness to a male airline employee shout loudly and aggressively at a fellow traveller. Albeit I don't know the nature of the customers query but he appeared calm and certainly didn't present himself in such a way to provoke such an unprofessional response from staff. Credit to the costumer he remained calm even after he was treated in the same way by a second male Pegasus attendant!!
It was seriously shameful behaviour for a presumably paid employee to exhibit. What a horrible way to treat anyone irrelevant of the situation or ""pressure"" of the job.
Quite frankly it really put me off both the airport (which admittedly is a shame) and most the airline.

Side note; My flight was uneventful and cabin crew were pleasant and professional.",6,"2017",1

Check-in in BCN took forever, having 2 counters for a whole plane!
On-plane crew was nice and helpful.

There is no 24/7 customer service(At least in Spain), the line was busy for 9 hours continuously!!!

It means that you have to farewell with your ""luggage""! Everything is a trap to rip you off! better to pay more cash, and travel without any concern, with a more premium airline.

Detailed Version:
I bough a ticket for 30th of May. The price was 133euros (1 luggage), since my plan was tentative I bought ""Flex"" feature for 15 euros. What is Flex?
""Pegasus Flex is a product that allows customers to change their ticket a limitless number of times without incurring any extra charges. It is offered to customers during the ticket purchase process either online or from our agents. If the new ticket is more expensive than the old one, you must pay the difference in price.""

In the night of 29th, due to a mishap, I figured out that I cannot fly on 30th.
So I thought I can change my flight with paying the difference of prices. Guess what? The only ticket that I could buy for ANY DATE, was a ""basic"" ticket: Without Luggage!!!! So it means that ""Flex feature"" is a big lie. You can change your ticket but you can only downgrade to ""basic"", to have a cabin luggage only!!!!!! My first ticket was ""essential"", with a luggage.

I decided to call the customer service.
I called the 24/7 customer service, and surprise: The line was busy from midnight till 9 am next day!!!
Then at 9:30am someone answered and told me that I have to pay 83euros for changing the flight!!! I bought the first ticket for 133, the next flight was 169, so 169-133 = 36, and not 83 euros!!!!
I told the customer service let me think. Then I called again 3 hours before flight, they said now I have to pay 120euros!!!!!! I checked, the price of the next flight was still 169!

The customer service never gave me the best option, since it was more profitable (10 euros or so) for them to sell me another ticket in this way.

I am over with these nickel and dime businesses. The ""terms and conditions"" business style, which charges you for some imaginary features, and then you figure out that almost never you can use that feature. I bought my new ticket from a more expensive airline, after the 100euros damage experience!",5,"2017",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","POOR AIRPLANE, A LOT OF DELAYS","the crew was nice, the airplane was dirty and a lot of delays, 4 hours delay for 50 minutes flight. shame",5,"2017",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Best low budget","Well now,,,i have taken a lot of low budget, but this was the best i ever had. Seats was not the typical low budget, but enoguh space for legs and comfertable, slept a great deal, but the food was the big suprise,,,best food on an airline ever. Got griled chiken with potatos, medeiterrain salad with extra virgin oil and a half lemon to make it more tasty, fresh bread and a tasty chocolate mouse to top it off.....staff helpfull and friendly.",5,"2017",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Cheap flight but better than most budget airlines","When I booked this flight I didnt expect much from it but the plane was brand new, leg space was decent for a budget airline.

The staff were helpful, all my flights (London - Istanbul - Antalya) were all on time and no fuss regarding baggage.

100 times better than Easyjet or Ryanair.

I didnt bother having any on board food but prices are what you expect, If your flight is short bring snacks or eat prior.

The price of the flight was decent for time of the year.

I would recommend this airline - worth it if you are going Turkey",5,"2017",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Do not Travel Through Pegasus AirLine to avoid Nightmare","Me and my family got a ticket from Calicut Kerala to Dublin, Ireland, We checked in through air india to Dubai. We have been told that we can collect our baggage in Dublin. When we reached in Dubai Pegaus counter staff said you need to pay more money as pegagus don't allow 23 kilogrames per bag. I said I don't know that, then he was very rude, if you don't pay you will not get your baggage. Then I said I do not have money now as I never expected something like that. They gave us the boarding pass it was on 22nd may fligght No PC 741. When we reached in Dublin our main baggage is missing. Now Pegagus says to contact air india. Please avoid Pegasus airlines. They are the worst airlines, they need money for each and every thing, they don't give any water for free.",5,"2017",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Typical budget airline","Pegasus is a decent budget airline. I'd rank it below EasyJet but above Ryanair. Unlike many, hold luggage (20kg) was included in the price of the ticket, which was good. Take food with you because an average coffee and a kit-kat bar will cost you £5! Leg room was as good as you can expect in this class, the service was fine and the flight punctual.",5,"2017",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Cheap flight with a small luggage","That is a really cheap and nice company. However If you have excess luggage, you are in trouble. They count every gram. In the plane you have to pay for everything. I still recommend this company because It is really economical and safe.",5,"2017",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","will not do it again","delayed 2 hours in departing from Stansted airport.
bad service.
old broken seats.
landed in Antalya because of mist and there we have a very bad experience with the customer service employees with ignorance to our questions. At least they should give us a breakfast with waiting for about 5 hours in Antalya airport to go back to Istanbul",5,"2017",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Budget is what you get","We booked a flight from Izmir via Istanbul to Athens as per previous review first flight was okay the the next flight, we were informed that our flight from Istanbul to Athens had changed from 2pm departure to 11am departure as we were in Pamukkale we decided to come back to Izmir a day early to avoid driving 3.3hrs and leaving at 5-30am to make our flight at 11am
We booked into the airport hotel and visited the Pegasus desk to make sure everything was okay all systems go for 11am next morning.
We arrived at the check in desk at 9 am 2 hrs prior to our flight and was told we were to early as we were in a 1pm flight which we were not told about the day before or not notified about as it didn't affect our next flight we were okay with it. We went and sat down to look at our booking to find that I had a seat which we paid extra to book but my wife didn't, we went back to the counter to be told my wife's seat will be assigned at check in which we could not understand when we paid extra for seats 1A and 1B all they wanted to do was refund our money but all we wanted was the seats we had been assigned and paid for, after much discussion with different people from Pegasus my wife was given her seat next to me. Not very professional probably would look at other airlines before I book with Pegasus again",5,"2017",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Okay flight","If you want a reasonably budget reliable airline this was okay for us on this flight next review a little different",5,"2017",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Superb service and seamless check in","The best check in service we ever experienced. There were so many counters and the service was very professional. The flight was no frills and leg room was pathetic . There was no in flight entertainment. Ok for short haul.",5,"2017",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Everything is OK, as usual","Pleasant flight attendants, new aircrafts, good connections, many destinations. I'm using Pegasus Airlines 3-4 times a year.",5,"2017",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Budget","A nice cheap way to get to Istanbul, when you don't pay much for the ticket you can't expect much in return.",5,"2017",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Below average","Last year, I flew from Istanbul-SAW to Vienna with Pegasus and can't say that I was very satisfied. The flight was delayed by 2 hours and ground staff refused to give us explanations regarding this delay. The seats were relatively comfortable on the 737-800, yet the legroom was atrocious. I hated the fact that they don't serve complimentary drinks and meals on a 2h 10m flight, so I pre-ordered a hot meal for just over 10 Euros, but the meal (Beef with Potatoes) turned out to be an utter disappointment, since it did not correspond in any way with the description I was given while reserving the meal; the beef was overcooked and the potatoes were underdone. The landing was also surprisingly hard, despite excellent weather conditions in Vienna. Moreover, the flight attendants need to attend some additional hospitality (and language acquisition) training - urgently!",5,"2017",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Proudly the World's Worst Airline","I have to admit this time its my fault to book with them again after my first horrible attempt that I have reviewed here as well. Fool me once....you know the rest.

I have taken 4 flights (1 round trip) with them before, and all 4 flights had delays and baggage was lost on the way.

This time, from the very beginning, the flight got delayed for more than 6 hours meaning missing my connection in Istanbul, meaning more than 24 hours delay in my whole trip.

I won't rant for long, but do yourself a favor, pay a bit extra in any other airline and avoid this please, I know their price is catchy, that's how I fell for them again. I ended up paying a USD 1000 for an alternative last minute flight with Qatar Airways to proceed with my trip, all because I wanted to save a few bucks.

Please, don't book with them, you have been warned. 100% of my flights with them have been delayed.",5,"2017",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Not that comfortable, but budget friendly","Nothing much to say really. A fairly average experience. Seats are not very comfortable and legroom was narrow. No meals during flight. But to be fair, that's normally expected from a budget low-cost airline.",5,"2017",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Excelent with a real good price","An excelent expirience flying to Milan with one stop in Istanbul.The plain was new with good space for yor feet.",5,"2017",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Best you can get with this price","Pegasus is a low-cost airline if you follow their promotions and stay alert. It is meaningless to complain about an airline that is carrying you from Amsterdam to Antalya for 99 Euros and from Bodrum to Antalya for 18 Euros just because they are selling a bottle of water on board for 3 euros. They are perfect option for short distances. Their only problem is to cancel some flights due to the low sales and long delays that can be more than an hour...Their on-board crew is kind and the service is good....",4,"2017",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Most terrible experience","Air Manas is an airlines belonging to Pegasus.
21st April

I had boarded air Manas flight from DEL-FRU on 21st April. The Air conditioning was not working resulting into suffocation, extreme sweating and unbearable closed air.

Then the flight was delayed by 40 minutes.This added to more problems.

Even after take off the air-conditioning did not work. After one hour in air, we could start breathing normal.

Needs to improve and change aircraft if their air-conditioning is not working....that too to hot countries like India.",4,"2017",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst airline service ever!","The 4 of us were travelling from Denizli to Istanbul last Nov. We had been travelling for a few days and didn't get a chance to web check in. So we went to the airport 3 hours earlier to check in at the counter.
We were first in line, however when the counter finally opened, our names did not appear in their system. The girl at the counter asked us to step aside while they investigate the issue, Their ""please wait 5 minutes"" took nearly 3 hours!! We nearly missed our flight. They checked-in all other passengers who queued after us and everytime we asked them how much longer we have to wait, they just ignored us and spoke to each other in Turkish.
5 minutes before the plane leaves and after there were no more people queueing, they actually wrote our name at the boarding pass BY HAND! No explanation or apologies were given and they had the cheek to tell us to hurry to the plane or we will miss our flight!!
Worst experience ever!! I will never fly Pegasus again!",4,"2017",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Efficient no-frills flying","Pegasus is a low-cost airline, so it would be foolish to expect the standards of comfort or amenities that you get from a regular airline. The seats are narrower and more cramped than a regular airline, legroom is less, and baggage weight restrictions are strictly enforced, so you need to be aware of that. And of course there is no inflight entertainment and no meals are included, although you can buy food and drink on board (for inflated prices). Within those limitations, however, it's good enough, a clean, efficient airline that gets you where you need to go.",4,"2017",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","No problem","We had flight from Tel Aviv to Bergamo and back with stopover in Istanbul, it was cheapest thickets we may find,service was good.",4,"2017",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","No legroom, only upright position","Took this flight after staying in the airport in Istanbul. As a pretty big hub I'd expect to get a free wifi, but it's possible only with a phone or buying something in 30 Turkish Lyra or more. Also pretty difficult to get a power outlet, not so accommodating.
There was a delay in the flight that wasn't announced, si we left 30 min later, getting used to them late...
in the plane there was barely legroom, and more than that the back position was fixed on a very uncomfortable position, couldn't even rest like that.
Whenever I can, I'll try to avoid them next time.",4,"2017",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Cost effective","Took a flight from Geneva and was surprised with the legroom in the plane, which was great. Unfortunately we were waiting in the plane for 30 min until the plane left in 30 min delay.",4,"2017",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Cost benefit ratio","Good cost benefit ratio, they do on a current basis promotions with excellent discounts, I used them several times and exclude some delays ( once or twice up to an hour) usually - good experience.",4,"2017",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Horrible. Do not travel with Pegasus","I will never travel again with Pegasus airlines. I flew from Doha to London and had an overstop in Istanbul. It has been my worst experience ever. They lost my baggage. They forgot it in Istanbul. So I spent 3 days in London without anything. It wasted my time, I mean my holidays here. Also the service is very poor",4,"2017",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Avoid this Airline, don't let a low price destroy your holiday","We were stranded for one day in Istanbul on our way to Athens, and the Pegasus personell together with the airport staff created a unfriendly, hostile experience. they kept us waiting so long, that not just us, but tens of people missed connecting flights including long and expensive international flights. They did not care, gave no information and got angry with us for asking questions and information and even yelled at us. they frustrated us so much, it lead to my pregnant wife crying and others going insane. If you can avoid this airline, don't let a cheaper price lure you in this amateur company.",4,"2017",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Got us from Point A to Point B in one Piece on time","We found Pegasus to be adequate and on time. There is not much leg room and I struggled to get into my seat. However on one leg of the journey there were many empty seats so I was able to stretch out. They charge for everything (water 1.5 euros, sandwich 6 euros). No entertainment or freebies. But safe enough and staff was attentive. There were some disruptive passengers talking loudly on one flight and I would have liked to have seen the flight attendants take some action as others were disturbed. Another issue is the English of some of the staff is not very good. But we got to our destination safely.",4,"2017",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","You get what you pay for","Pegasus is a budget airlines, so please don't be one of those dim wits that pay a third for the flight and expect first class service ok, if you want to pay a third, then you don't get food, your body is almost GPS guided, you have to be precise to fit in hahaha, but overall it's what I expected, I got where I wanted to be and that's what's important. ...thank you...",4,"2017",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","nice budget airline","its nice budget airline with good service and on time flights very low fair if you book early and good service on board",4,"2017",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","GOOD QUALITY MEDIUM PRICES","We travelled on 31st January early morning from Tbilisi to Istanbul with Pegasus. The flight was very good, there were comfort seats and they allowed us to have a luggage 15Kg.",4,"2017",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Easy and Low cost","I have flown with Pegasus several times and never had any problems.
I feel happy and satisfied and will fly with them agin very soon",4,"2017",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Low cost. No frills","This was the only airline that had 5 seats for my family to fly from Istanbul to cappadocia. It was clean. The leg room was less than on Turkish airlines. They did not serve any food. The attendants were very nice. I felt safe-- but nothing extra: no frills. It was less expensive than any other airlines. Flying domestic in turkey is MUCH less than flying domestic in the United States.",4,"2017",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Good low cost","Probably one of the best low cost I traveled with. Clean comfortable and on time! The right price and a good service. All the planes are not over 5 years old. The food proposed is good and not expensive.",4,"2017",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","I enjoyed PGS for the first time","It was the first time I enjoyed a Pegasus flight. The flight was not full. The price for service was excellent. No food, no water, but a flight on time. Cheap airport transfer option in Istanbul. The only negative thing is service in the flight. It turns to a supermarket.",4,"2017",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","PLEASANT SURPRISE","I needed to get to the Asian Side of Istanbul in a hurry and elected to not fly Turkish Airlines and instead took Pegasus to Sabiha Gokcen Airport - a 1.5 hour flight at best.
The flight was fine, the plane was good and timely and the lack of a sandwich was no big deal.
Will certainly use the Airline again when I need to reach Asia Minor and avoid the time consuming nightmarish traffic across Istanbul.
Also the Airport was a pleasant surprise - quiet, efficient and without queues!",3,"2017",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Good flight but bad service","Unlike Turkish Airlines, in Pegasus, you have to pay for everything you consume on board. Also the timings of the flight are not that great. It is always at early morning in the destination.",3,"2017",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Appalling customer service","Check-in staff at Stansted didn't even know the airline flew to Bishkek. It was immediately disconcerting that they were unsure if our baggage would be transferred in Istanbul. The flight was slightly delayed, which meant we missed our connection in Istanbul. They had clearly sold a connecting flight that was almost impossible to make.

The main problem is the customer service. To their credit, Pegasus put us up in a hotel, but they made us wait two hours for the shuttle to take us there - it was a 5 minute drive. Ridiculous. A bit of communication, and we could have just walked or paid for a taxi. The staff were rude and didn't seem to understand that we were in a frustrating situation.

Pegasus covered the cost of our Turkish visa (eventually), but refused to even acknowledge messages about the first day of a tour that we missed. Their phone staff said they had no email addresses and the airline clearly wants to make it as tough as possible to contact them.

Very very poor.",3,"2017",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","depends on where you want to fly","the flight was cheap but the plane is very dense,
not enough leg space and food prices are pretty high.
service is ok",3,"2017",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Great value airline!","I flew Pegasus on a short flight from Istanbul to Bucharest. The price was right, even including a checked bag (8 kg for cabin luggage is tight). The aircraft seemed to be older, but the seat was one of the comfier I've experienced on a budget airline! Customer service was excellent- there was an issue at the gate with our boarding passes and the crew reassured us they would resolve it, swiftly did so, and we were on our way!",3,"2017",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Good Luck - worst experience ever...","Hands down this was the WORST airline I've ever used. Flights consistently late if not cancelled completely. Desk employees incredibly rude, not helpful AT ALL. I believe their motto is ""there is nothing I can do"". Our family had booked several flights within Turkey during a 2 week period. At one point we waited for our incoming plane to arrive, hourly reports from Pegasus desk telling us it was delayed...3 hours later the desk shut down, Pegasus employees went home. We went to a different airline's info desk, they informed us the plane was not going to arrive and that our flight was cancelled. Stranded in the middle of Turkey with 4 children... Spent most of the night on the phone arranging another flight, zero refund from Pegasus, zero help from Pegasus. We got help from our credit card company! DO NOT USE PEGASUS - NOT EVEN AS A LAST RESORT!!!",3,"2017",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","The worst airlines ever ,racist and a very bad survice","A very very bad way to deal with clients , an awful English language by the crew
A long history of missing luggage and hand bags.
Phone workers are vey rude.
They are very racists .
Not responsible at all.",3,"2017",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst airlines i have ever seen","The biggest queue i have ever seen in aiport and for check-in (Sabiha airport). I was come 2 hours before flight to airport and wait almost 2 hours in queue (i was checked in online but automats for print tickets was not working) after that it was the same queue for pasport control and i had only 10 minutes before bording so i must buy ticket for fast line to pasport control (that i was not plan in my budget) so you should come at least 3 hour before flight and plan your budget for pay fast line. Also inside airplane you can buy something only with mastercard but not visa so you should have some cash because it's almost impossible to pay with card",3,"2017",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Good enough","Pegasus is one of the airlines in Turkey. Its prices are pretty reasonable. The only problem is Pegasus's all flights go through SABİHA GÖKÇEN AIRPORT in İstanbul which is located quite far away from city Center and it makes difficult to reach.

When you click to see prices of flight, it makes you believe it's actually cheap but it doesnt show you how much you have to pay in total. I call it temporary happiness of Pegasus. after taxes you see almost double price sadly. Even they dont serve any sandwich or baverage. Sooo annoying, even if it's a domestic flight. You have to pay in the plane which is also ashamed for hosts and hostes. they take money and gives coins to passengers. I definitely think they should figure this problem out.",3,"2017",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Nice low cost flights. on time. nice staff.","Had a trip with a connection flights. all pegasus, I find them to be on time, nice and for low cost flights I would recommand flying with them.",3,"2017",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Bad but cheap!","It's cheap, and obviously you get cheap quality, you pay for a seat you get a seat! if you need anything else to consume you have the choice! not comfy but again it saves you money, and that's what we need sometimes! Recommended if you're on a tight budget!",3,"2017",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","WORST","Worst decision of my entire life, awful service and my flight was delayed TWICE, missing my connection. The service itself is mediocre. I was just happy to get to my destination in one piece.

Will not fly pegasus ever again.",3,"2017",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worlds worst","Seriously, how does a business live with is standard of service. Absolutely dreadful airline. No online check in at many airports - really?? First two flights both late. Yes, you need to buy your own food, but overnight flights with nothing at al - no blanket, no cushion, rock hard seats... dreadful. Coming back was even worse. It was total chaos at the gate in Istanbul. Chaos. When we got on board, they had to check tickets again as someone had been allowed to get on THE WRONG PLANE! How's that for safety and security and immigration controls??? This takes low cost airlines to a new low. Adverts throughout the planes... I mean, it was like a bus. Awful awful experience and I will gladly tell everyone that I know to NEVER book with Pegasus.",3,"2017",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Turkish Way of Low Cost Airliner!","I think the best low cost carrier in the world which I experienced a many all over the world. Very innovative in terms of pay to go products . More service if you pay more, very simple and smart. Also they didn't lose the Turkish Hospitality. Because low cost model is very out of Turkish way of living. Therefore result is less low cost feeling and more feeling like a guest instead of shipping material which is very unusual for low cost carriers. You have 15kg baggage + 8kg cabin baggage allowence. This is free! Even some flag carrier airlines do not provide this for free...",3,"2017",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","PC 602 was good","this was on 18th Feb, I pre booked the A1 seat and the legroom was good, seat also fine. Staff was friendly & the flight is clean. Service & the food was really good.",3,"2017",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Good one too","First of should comment about the boarding, it was horrible @ the Madrid Airport. This was on 18th Feb. The staff of boarding was not friendly & they didn't have an idea what they are doing. When Its come to the flight, I got the A1 seat. It was ok, but the seat wasn't comfortable as expected, flight is good & clean. Staff was good. Food was ok, i found it bit raw, but it was not that bad. Actually I prepaid for a Veg meal (Pasta) & mistakenly they gave me a Meatballs rice, but immediately they changed it. It wasn't an issue.",3,"2017",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","whatever they try to be good,not gonna work","whatever they do to get more customers,never gonna work unless they change the mentality.I strongly recommend you to not fly with this aircraft company.when i was flying domestic route something was stolen from my baggage and yet flypgs done notting.this is just beginning...when i complaint about this situation they replied my complaint after 1 month...service,flight attendants were and still are lack of manners...",3,"2017",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Delays, otherwise ok","Had four flights with Pegasus in Feb/March 2017. The first leg on my way to Dubai was two hours delayed, just barely made my connection in Istanbul. My second time was from Kuwait via Istanbul to Oslo, everything on time this time.
Service ok, legroom a bit small, otherwise ok flights.
On one or more of the flights it was not possible to adjust the seats.",3,"2017",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Kind service & Yummy food","I booked the A1 seat, but the legroom wasn't that good. The food is very tasty & the crew were so friendly. Actually I couldn't pre pay for the water I was under the impression that the water is included in the meal (it should be included, paying for water after the meal is a joke, the airline should add a small bottle of water to the meal pack), I didn't have change since the water bottle is very cheap (I think 1 Euro), but the kind crew offered me a glass of water free of charge. That should admire. Flight is clean & safe.",3,"2017",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Better than expected","I pre booked the A1 seat, it was comfortable & could be manage. On board service also good. The crew was so friendly and the food was fine. I ordered Cold Breakfast Tray 2 and it was average few fruit Pieces were bitter, but the rest of all were fine. Flight is clean & the staff is very helpful, but they should consider for one thing. The crew were so loud while talking to each others :) they better think of the people who are trying to sleep in the flight. Bottom line, I'm satisfied about the service.",3,"2017",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","NOT BAD","The plane did not leave on time but this was because of too much air traffic in Istanbul Sabihya Gocen airport where you change planes. If you can avoid this airport in fact avoid Istanbul because of very inefficient passport control which will nearly ensure you miss your plane. It is a nightmare to try to catch your connection in either of the Istanbul airports.",3,"2017",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","not the best airline","Pegasus lost my luggage and found after 1 month :) they already paid me compensation but it takes a lot of emails and phones and patience. And thank god they found my luggage.",3,"2017",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Hichhiking as air travel!","If you are in good health, do not have high blood pressure, of average size and buy your food before stepping on board, then this is a very cheap way to travel. Even a cup of coffee on board will cost you a minor fortune. For some reason, they cannot handle transfer boarding cards so you are forced to queue for ever to get your next boarding card. Organised chaos - but very cheap.",3,"2017",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Average","You can't expect much, however you are welcomed well. Their ads give you the idea that they are very cheap. In fact, if you do not buy very early, they are not so cheap. The prices seems fine though. They do not serve you anything when you travel. You need to have your snack if you travel long. Their staff are friendly and professional. Besides they have nice planes.",3,"2017",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Not any different flying with Jet 2 or any budget airline","After reading reviews of this airline we were a bit apprehensive however, we were pleasantly surprised. Crew do speak English. The flight was exactly the same as any other budget airline. Would fly with them again",3,"2017",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Terrible, terrible and even more treeible.","We took a flight from Stanstead to Antalya. There being no direct flight so it involved 2 separate flights, with a change of aircraft in Istanbul. At check in we got in conversation with the girl, who mentioned that because this flight left at 25 minutes past midnight EVERY DAY around 10/12 people turned up 24 hours late to catch their flight because they mistakenly believed their flight to be on the following day because of the 24 hour clock. We asked if the passenger came late for check in did they make a small charge to change the ticket to facilitate their journey. Surprisingly she said that the entire ticket was cancelled and the ""late passengers"" had to buy a new tickets at full price. Granted it is the onus of the traveller to check, but if this is happening every single day with 10/12 travellers....I call it a legal con.

On boarding the flight I noticed they had fixed seats with no recline whatsoever, something I have never seen on an international flight. There was no in flight entertainment at all. For some reason which they choose not to tell us, the flight departed just over 30 minutes late. There was no explanation, mention or apology. They made announcements on numerous occasions in Turkish, followed by a brief inaudible message in English. At least once I am sure they did not even attempt to put this message in English. Just before landing, there was no customary announcement by the Captain, to thank us for flying with their airline etc., or no mention of weather conditions or the local time in Istanbul !!! The next leg of the journey departed an hour late with a brief message relayed after about 30 minutes of scheduled departure to inform us about the delay and that too not when we should expect to take off...which took a further 30 minutes or so. Same standard of announcements on this flight. I decided not to pen this review and thought I will see how we got on with our return flight 1 week later.

Our experience of return flight ditto..ditto...ditto. In Antalya we had made a lot of purchases amongst them were 10 boxes (12 in a set) of beautiful glass tea cups and other delicate items, we mentioned this at check in and requested a Fragile sticker to be put on both our bags. We were stunned by her answer "" Pegasus do not believe in FRAGILE and so she could not put these stickers "" 1st Flight 30 minutes or so late., which made our connection very tight. I fully expected someone to be waiting at the plane exit to whisk us to the connecting flight (something which I have experienced when through no fault of ours we were late catching a connection). Instead when we asked any Airline staff we saw, we were pointed to a long passport control queue, security check queue, flight check queue etc with no regard to the time. By this time the time for our scheduled departure had passed. We made enquiries over and over again as to if the flight had left, where was our baggage which was checked in to Stanstead. We walked for ages and finally managed to get to the flight gate. I enquired about the flight status, all three staff who were there just looked at me and just rushed me along., giving us he impression that we had somehow delayed the flight and should have been there earlier. On boarding the aircraft (all passengers were seated) waiting for us giving the impression that it was our fault that we were so late. I had to ask the stewardess if we were on the right flight, if our baggage had been loaded, and if the flight was delayed and by how long? She confirmed that we were on this being the correct flight and said that the baggage should be on the flight (I kept my fingers crossed) and as seems to be their policy made no mention as to how late the flight was likely to depart. It did depart about 30 minutes late.
So, four flights all delayed, with little or no apology. Must give them credit for one thing though, our very last flight the seats were only marginally more comfortable with a slight recline. I am really fuming now. Just got home and unpacked and 3 of these irreplaceable glasses are broken.",2,"2017",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","More then what I excpected","I am really suprised to see that; I have got 5 star service. I have flown IST ATHENS IST I have got emergency exit seat free of charge planes were on time ond check in was very fast cabin crew were nice and the planes were new and clean I am so happy. The tickets were very reasonable priced I ve got more then what I ask for. I definitely recommend Pegasus to everyone.",2,"2017",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Nothing bad to say about them","Everything you would expect from a european low-cost carrier. I think people complaining about the service don't get the low-cost thing. In-flight crew are nice and the food is neither bad nor expensive. My return flight was delayed for an hour or so because ""they were chaning the plane's tires"" which sounded a bit crazy. In any case my flight connection worked out and everything went fine.",2,"2017",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Delay 2 times in 2 flights more that 3 hours","On the 12th of February my husband and I traveled by Pegasus from Tel Aviv to Istanbul and from Istanbul to Amsterdam. On the first flight PC780 there was a delay of more than 3 hours the scheduled departure at 7:20 p.m. only occurred at 11:00 p.m. This made us miss the second PC671 flight at 10:30 a.m. The pegasus then boarded us on the flight PC477

This with departure scheduled for 19:00 only embarked at around 10:45 a.m., again a delay of more than 3 hours, all on the same trip. The only justification they gave us was for technical reasons. These delays caused the loss of a Transavia flight that we had for day 12 at 16:50 with departure from Amsterdam to Faro (Portugal). We had to buy 2 new last minute flights for € 100 per person for the next day to Faro. In these delays, we were not provided assistance, we were not offered meals, not water, just coffee. We were not given a telephone or internet to try to change the Transavia flight.

The service was very bad and caused us problems on a professional level as we arrived at the destination one day after we planned. Terrible

We were quite displeased with this situation. 2 flights with 2 delays exceeding 3 hours

I complain with Pegasus, that did nothing. Never fly for Pegasus again.",2,"2017",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","NO CUSTOMER SERVICE","The airplanes are quite comfortable for a low-cost airline. And if you don't change anything in the itinerary it goes fine. I have never flown on time with them. Expect even long delays.
Once, I had to miss my return flight but never got an answer by email, nor by telephone line. The lines did not even ring. Once someone answered after several tries but did not speak English. Unbelievable.",2,"2017",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Cheap flights equals strict baggage rules","Overall Pegasus is one of those airlines where you pay for what you get. It was a fine flight but note that there are no free foods or drinks.

Pro tips:
-Bring food and water as seeing other eat/drink probably will make you hungry/thirsty.
-There is no in-flight entertainment so download something on Netflix or bring a book.
-DO NOT exceed the baggage weight limit. Some airlines may be nice with 1 extra kilo but Pegasus is very strict about the weight limit! Even for hand luggage, so try to stay way under the limit or buy extra prior to arriving to the airport.",2,"2017",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","love the coffee menu...","departure and arrival on time... what more a passenger can expect?

last week went to ankara most economically on pegasus. all was ok. stewardesses w smiling face. landing super and craft was brand new. thanks pegasus.",2,"2017",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","First and last time","My first and last time with pegasus airlines.
First let me begin with their helpful office in beirut. The moment i arrived i asked the ""i wanna get through with my day kinda lady"" if the ticket is refundable if ever the visa was rejected she said no, and if i want later on to use the ticket for another flight it will cost me double the price. Hein?! My friend asked how much we pay if we wanted to get another bag. The lady said around 40usd for an additional 20kgs bag. Anyway i dont know what got into me but we booked.
On the ""airplane"" i was chocked it looked like a school bus only less cool. It was not comfortable at all, thank God the flight was not too long. We could track the flight on a screen in one out of 4 flights from beirut to paris (istambul in the middle) in the other airplanes (airbus) the screens were not working.
The flight attendants dont speak english. Sweetie we dont ask you to be fluent but a basic english is required , i mean who knows turkish?!?!?
Of course they dont offer anything not even water.but than again who wants to eat when the food smell was so bad and the air-conditioning so poor.
they dont turn off the light during night.they did only for few minutes.
On the way back they made my friend pay 155euros for an additional carry on of 11kgs when in beirut they told us that 20 additional kgs were for 40$!!! 155euros more than the ticket price.
And for those of you who think this is a cheap flight, it is not that cheap for the ZERO services they offer, meanwhile a direct flight with a respectful airline was only 80$ more expensive. But we had already booked with pegasus and the ticket is ""not refundable"".
And of course the way back flight from paris to istambul was delayed for 1hour. They didnt even bother mentioning that before and we were gonna miss our flight to beirut from istambul.
Bad airline, bad crew, not recommended.",2,"2017",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Domestic Flight: Turkey","Despite self promoting itself as a budget airline, it is almost always possible to find a cheaper flight when planned ahead. Customer support is close to none. Flights are always late. Seats are cramped even for a moderately sized male. Cabin is generally dirty. Senior cabin crew is moody.
No complementaty food or beverage. Also those things are luxury level expensive.
So why does one fly with them? Well they fly frequently.",2,"2017",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Budget Airlines","Flight could badly do with some form of entertainment, 4/5 hours staring at the back of a seat can get fairly boring, credit cards would not work so only for one very nice lady who paid for water for us, we would have been 5 hours with not a drop, they only accepted euro's which is a disaster.",2,"2017",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","=delay","Always delays. Even for the shortest flights. They try to make u pay for everything except the toilets at the plane",2,"2017",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Great for getting from A to B","Had a good flight attendants looked after us well. Food much the same as all other airlines and the same kind of prices.
The flight was a bit like being on a bus as we stopped at Istanbul to let off half the other passengers who were replaced with new passengers, the wait was about one hour.
Would fly with flypgs again.",2,"2017",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Modern aircraft with a quintessential Turkish service","I have flown frequently with Pegasus and have to say that you get what you pay for. My only gripe is when trying to make connecting flights, the process can be quite slow and laborious, but Im not sure how much of that is Pegasus Airlines or Turkish Government red tape? Just remember that you are flying a Turkish airline and not easyJet!",2,"2017",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Fly only if you have to..","Yes it is cheap, but it comes at another price. For 4 hours strait we were subjected to visual torture of continous commercial video clips. I am sure it is prohibited by the law to show same puctures over and over again.

More over, they are proud of this ""marketing tool"" , take a look at my pic, they even promote it ""99% remembered rate""!! For sure we all know the commercials frame by frame!!

New plain ok, but air con was not activated..

As for the stuff - you just see they hate both passanges and their work..",2,"2017",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Low Cost.. OK to travel","We have traveled many times from Pegasus airlines, have no complains as compared to the cost. It states as low cost and low frill airline which is what it is. Did not have any issues or complaints. No fancy expectations and no extra frills. Good for travelers who travel with budget. Leg space is less , so please consider if you are looking for a comfortable seating then you need to think again. The seating is cramped and close. But honestly, I dint expect anything more.",2,"2017",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","The worst customer service I've ever experienced!!","On the 4th July 2016, me and a friend arrived at Sharm Al Sheikh Airpot only to find that our 06:45 flight to Turkey Istanbul (Sabiha Gokcen) was delayed by two and a half hours. Disappointed but not distraught, we settled in at the airport and was offered one measly soft drink each for the inconvenience caused.

We were eventually allowed to board the flight 3 hours later, however, on arrival at at Turkey Istanbul (Sabiha Gokcen) Airport. We had to run around trying to find a helpful member of staff, we discovered our onward connecting flight to London Gatwick had departed. Meaning we had missed our connecting flight due to the delay at Sharm Al Sheikh.

We were then offered two options.
a) Stay in a hotel overnight and get the next flight to LGW the next day or
b) Take another flight to London Stansted Airport

Understandably after the recent attacks at Istanbul in June we were reluctant to stay overnight and accepted to be placed on the next London Stansted flight. We were very disappointed and at times, rendered speechless with the careless disregard and bad attitude displayed by Pegasus staff in the way they dealt with the flight delay, consequential missed connection flight and lack of information provided throughout our entire delayed return journey to London.

To top it all off, Pegasus airlines lost our baggage and it was not returned to us for 4 days.

To date the airline have not replied to letters, emails, phone calls and not had the decency to even respond after I completed their online complaints form..

THIS AIRLINE IS DISGUSTING AND ACCEPTS NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIER ERRORS AND OFFERS NO APOLOGIES OR EXPLANATIONS!!!

PLEASE KEEP AWAY!",2,"2017",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","no help with problems","While the plane and the flight itself was ok for a low cost airline, the service certainly was not. We landed in Istanbul (delayed flight) and had to catch a connecting Pegasus flight to Bodrum, and we had just 30 minutes left to board. The queue to passport control was very long. Pegasus representatives simply told us 'There's enough time to make it', which was obviously nonsense. Turkish airlines did help passengers through fast track. We did the same on our own and we made our flight. No thanks to Pegasus!",2,"2017",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Remarkable Improvement","Pegasus achieved a remarkable improvement within last year. Please note that I compare Pegasus to other budget airlines. If you start searching a cheap flight 3-4 months before your planned visit, you will definitely find an atractive price with several options (meal included etc). Similar, if you order your meal before your flight you will enjoy good price and choices. In a way Pegasus is performing even better than flag carriers, for example Russian speaking cabin crew is very helpful for the guests who donot speak either English or Turkish. To my view, Pegasus is the best among European budget airlines.",2,"2017",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Badservice, no care about clients","Were flying from Antalya to Moscow with shift in Istanbul in Sept'15. The flight was delayed, so we ran in Istanbul. As the queue to passport control was huge we asked Pegasus representative to lead us through as it was the air-company fault that we did not have enough time (as they delay the flight). But we got no help at all and no interest from Pegasus side. They said we cannot help, really, and that was all. Never will fly with Air Pegasus again.",2,"2017",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Great service, new aircraft, ample legroom","One of the best domestic flight experiences we've had.

The aircraft was new, the seat had ample legroom and the cabin crew provided a great service. Overall, a great flying experience for an early morning flight.",2,"2017",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Very average low cost airline","Not the best flying experience.Delayed both flights .Paid for extra leg room for my husband in seat 1c but he was continually knocked into and had his foot trodden on by passengers in the que for what appeared to be the only toilet at the front of the aircraft.
Announcements made in English were hard to understand as gabbled quickly.",1,"2017",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Decent service and no hassles","While I read a lot of negative reviews on the internet and was worried sick after a few days of non operation few days before I travelled, my travel was hassle free. They offer free 20 Kg baggage and additional cabin luggage (Cabin luggage is not weighed) and the baggages arrived on time despite the short connecting time. The flights were more or less on time. Leg room and seat comfort is not the best in business. Overall the service is neat and decent for a budget carrier.",1,"2017",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Very comfortable and fast","I was flying from Istanbul to Izmir. I choose Pegasus because of price, i couldn't imagine that serviсe will be so good. The main thing I like it's possibiliti to make check-in near special terminal with help of manager if u have not big bag they even won't check the weight of it, so u will be able to take it to the hand laggage without worries, person near terminal just give u sticker for your suitcase. If u came to the airport 1 hour before flight u don't need to wait in a long line for check-in. In general if u use domestic terminal in Turkey u don't need to worry about size of the bottle of your parfumes or cream. Also Pegassus have great service in a planes.",1,"2017",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Absolute Nightmare","Cancelled flights, very few staff to help. Inflexible in alternative arrangements. Chaos checking in, again no staff anywhere to help. A three and a half hour journey took 36 hours.",1,"2017",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Don't ever fly with them, not even if it's the cheapest option ever!","My flight from Doha to Istanbul and further to Almaty on January 9th 2017 at 3:50 in the morning was cancelled due to bad weather in Istanbul. The flight was cancelled at least 14 hours before the scheduled time. Neither myself, nor the rest of the passengers whom I met at the airport were sent emails informing of it.
I went to the airport 4 hours before the flight and met all these other passengers waiting for the check-in, only to be told by airport staff that the flight had been cancelled. Not a single pegasus rep was there. They just called the airport and told them to send us back home, easy as that. Many of the passengers had their visas expiring that very day. But sure, why would the pegasus worry about informing their passengers. We couldn't reach any of the pegasus 24/7 customer service numbers, neither could the airport staff reach their office. There was no further information, nothing at all, given to us regarding when and how we'll get to our destinations. I spent the night at the airport. The next morning myself and two other passengers went to the pegadus office in Doha, since we couldn't reach any of them by phone. The worst part was when we arrived at the office with our suitcases, exhausted from a sleepless night, hoping to get help from the airline reps, but they just told us it's not their problem. They jyst said they couldn't help since some of us used other websites to purchase their tickets. They didn't have the kindness to help us get our tickets refunded or rescheduled, or even contact the websites (we were all just visitting Doha, with no active sim cards or internet). We returned to the airport and I bought a ticket with Flydubai and flew that night.",1,"2017",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Terrible Flight Attendants","Really rude flight attendants. I had to wait for 11 hours whilst in Turkey, And so I was super tired when I boarded the plane, When I asked a flight attendant to help me stow my hand carry, he simply asked me to do it myself. Moreover, Pegasus airlines does not have anyone at the help desk, therefore, I almost cried when I was stranded without anyone helping me ( I did not know how to get a ticket whilst in transit). When a Turkish airport official found out that I was a minor he offered to help me and printed my ticket for me. Had it not been for that kind Turkish official, I wouldn't have made it to Bosnia. Please avoid this airline at all costs. And PLEASE DO NOT BOOK THIS FLIGHT FOR MINORS as there is no help whatsoever.",1,"2017",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","avoid it!","I don't want to say much about it.
Not good services, not complete details on the transition flight, noisy plane, most important don't put expensive things in you shipping bag.
However, the price cheaper compare to other airlines but there are something behind those prices!! the country is not very secure and safe after all.",1,"2017",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Excellent value for money","Pegasus is a completely OK airline despite some people told me otherwise. The booking from the airline page was flawless and they sent me email notification 1 day prior to my flights.
The only downside of these cheaper airlines is the limitation in baggage as well as lack of at least a glass of water for free during the flight. In short flights this is not some issue but I presume for a longer flights this could be a problem.
All in all, it was a pleasant flight.",1,"2017",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","So many extras","This airline may seem cheep but you have to pay for everthing. So they are just acting cheep. I hope I don't have to fly with them again.",1,"2017",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Yes its cheap but you pay the moments you live","the Oxygen level within your flight is of 0 I guess, they turn on and off the AC that sometimes you feel you can not breath and others you are cold. yes the ticket fare was like very tempting, but the aircraft it self is a place where we suffered specially how small it is with no good spaces. that was during our outbound flight till turkey where the transit was there of course. else the other trips aircrafts were a bit better. everything of course you need to pay for. for water, food , juice anything as its a charter flights as all others. the staff are not that bad on board as other reviews claim but yet there is no any medical assistance, one of our friends had onboard sickness and almost fainted but they knew nothing about what to do and thankfully there was a Dr onboard who helped when even we were the ones who asked them to ask about.
I won't forget on our way back there was a have storm when our first flight got delayed and then we finally got to Turkey they mentioned our transit flight would wait as of the storm but not surpassing when we arrived we found it departed and the only other available is the next day at night, they mentioned we would go and stay at their hotel for free at the airport but we just need to pass the immigration office, of course when we were trying the mentioned we need an entry visa to pass, we tried to explain as hard as we can and went to ask the pegasus representative again they didn't even bother to explain another guy at the airport explained, the immigration officers just gave the known straight face with no other words than (Turkish Visa Turkish visa) we got one online quickly that we paid for it and the airlines mentioned its cheap get it yourself. when we crossed suffering again to get our baggage and finally we got them after 2 hours. we went to see queues at the hotel entrance that they were putting some sort of barriers from the people. we decided we would go by our own and get ourselves a hotel to stay for the night and come next day.
I won't take it again, recommend it for just very short flights if you do not have any other option.",1,"2017",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Pegasus","Pegasus was a completely okay airline. Compared to competitors such as turkish airlines, you will not get such good benefits like a entertainment screen, but that is evened out by the price difference. They mainly use the 737, with the a320 on some northern european routes. Some 737s are fitted with the sky interior, and then you can hardly see any difference with this airline and a luxury competitor. The older 737s are a little used, with some seatbacks failing and things like that, but all around it isnt that bad. Their base, Istanbul Sabiha Gocken, is not a very interesting airport. You really need access to a lounge to have something else to do, otherwise a layover over three hours and youll get pretty bored. Visas cost money into Turkey, so if you are trying to save money, that probably wont happen. The crew was okay, I liked the book in advance food feature. Flights are not always at good times, my connection from istanbul was scheduled to leave at 23:50, but left at something like 03:30 (this was the night of the military coup in Turkey), and on the way back my first flight left Lebanon at 05:00.",1,"2017",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Not Bad","The airlines is quite ok, flight nice, sure not on time but the delay was more due to crowded runway. The sandwiches that we pre ordered were also good. What I dont like however is that the airlines changes the tickets prices drastically on a day to day and month to month basis and sometimes it is even more expensive that other major airlines. If it is marketed as a budget airlines then it should very well behave as one and not become opportunistic.",1,"2017",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Non-existing customer service","The plane was diverted to Antalya due to a severe snow storm, and then returned to Istanbul. Upon arrival, there was no customer service/information available. Pegasus knew about the snow storm since it happened at around 2 pm local time. The plane finally landed in Istanbul at 11 pm. Pegasus failed to confirm accommodation until 5 am, with no customer service phone numbers working and no information provided.
I guess that, in a good day when nothing exceptional happens, having an unexplained two hour delay is acceptable - as it has happened to me in the past the few times I have flown with them. However, being left stranded and completely unattended is not acceptable.",1,"2017",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Rude and unhelpful staff - Not the airline you want in a crisis","We booked a flight from Konya to Istanbul. Unfortunately, the airport grounded all the flights for reasons not disclosed. We assume it was because of the weather. We only discovered this when we arrived at the airport 2 hours before the scheduled flight. All the Pegasus staff member was willing to do was give me a telephone number to call to rearrange a later flight. She said flights were cancelled and she was just about to send all passengers an email in this regard. I never did receive an email and what good would it have served to have received it so late. She was clearly just making dishonest placatory comments. She offered no assistance or advice on how to deal with the situation of flights being cancelled. All she displayed was irratation and an urgency to dismiss me. In the meanwhile I had a taxi waiting with the meter running and my wife and 2 young children in the car and no hotel or working cellphone or access to any phone. Pegasus staff did not even offer the use of a phone to rebook the flight so I could decide whether to stay at the airport or go find a hotel to check-in to until the earliest flight was available. One would expect that airline staff would be experienced with such cancellations and were trained to contain passengers and give appropriate advice on the way forward. Even the staff member who did the rebooking over the telephone was extremely curt.

Pegasus airlines ground staff displayed a don't care attitude at a time of crisis. The true test of good service is not when things go as planned but when things go wrong. We live in an era where flying has become high risk. Passengers need assurance that in the event things turn catastrophic the airline will take care of them. If pegasus can't handle simple, regular flight cancellations professionally what can one expect from the airline in more difficult circumstances. Interestingly when I mentioned to a hotelier in Turkey that I booked a Pegasus flight he laughed and said Pegasus is the worst domestic airline in Turkey. Clearly Pegasus airline has much work to do. Until then Pegasus airlines cannot be recommended.",1,"2017",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","always the best for turkey","we use this airline for around 4 trips a year to turkey and find the comfort and service better than other airlines",1,"2017",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Bad airline","This is by far the worst airline I have flown with in over 35 years. NO service, bad food. Only native speaking, no english. Due to too much delay at departure time we almost lost the connecting flight in Istanbul. I am not looking forward to the return flight.",1,"2017",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Horrible Flight + Stay away!","Very rude crew in flight and seemed least interested in providing service. I had connecting flights hence crew on both had same attitude so maybe its common thing. Never going to try this airline again.",12,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst customer service","They broke my brand new suitcase on a flight from Tel Aviv to Cologne, via Istanbul. I got told I need to hand in a statement from a repair shop that the suitcase can't be repaired.
I handed in all the requested documents (to the email address they gave me) and never heard from them. After sending several emails I used their online form to file a complaint (after about 5 to 6 weeks). They then told me they would not refund the full cost of the suitcase despite it being brand new and also they wouldn't cover the cost of the statement letter they had requested.
I am a frequent flyer and I know luggage can break on a flight. But so far this has been handled very professionally by other airlines. Not so by Pegasus airlines! Very disappointing and will definitely not book a flight with them again.",12,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","This is by far the worse most careless airline I have ever flown in 35 years.","This airline is ran by a bunch of young kids that do not care whatever is a flight gets off the ground on time or how much havoc it costs the passengers schedule. Totally irresponsible! Their poor flight operations truncated a day of my vacation and it took three hours for them to get me in one of the worse hotels in Istanbul in the middle of the night.

I will never fly this airline again. Flights are late consistently without any cause, justification and even the delay times are wrong. The young kids running this night crew hand problems off to one another and never follow up to see if any of it gets solved.

Let them learn this enough of these reviews and you won't have an airline or a job.

If I could leave no circle in the rating I would have done it!",12,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","This airline makes you pay for your hand luggage before your board the flight terrible airline","This is the worst airline , please avoid them they are terrible
On 30th November as I was about the board the flight to Cyprus after checking your boarding pass, the staff will come up to you to say your hand luggage is excess and you must pay £45. The lady didn't even have the baggage weighing or dimension scale but it seems they are used to doing this to a lot of passengers so please avoid them by all cost. They want you to pay cash instead of using your card.
When I offered to pay the £45 by credit they entered my credit card details on their computer and said that my card has been rejected and they refused me boarding the flight. ( my bank has confirmed that my card was never rejected and they have given me a letter to prove it)
This was the worst experience of my life but they didn't seem to care at all and there was no other flight on that day. The staff are so mean and stone faced and they told me to come back the next they to fly. Never go on Pegasus please, I had the worst experience of my life.
I had to pay £150 one way to get on another flight to laneca in Cyprus and €150 by taxi to my destination .
When I complained online,they said that their hand luggage allowance is only 8kg and if I offered to pay and the card didn't work it is not their problem. They have terrible customers service and I hope their chief executive can read some of the comments here.
How can an airline staff be so mean not to let someone on the flight because of a small hand luggage and also the fault of their machine not accepting my card. I am beginning to think that they wanted cash off me that's why they said my card was rejected, they asked for cash but I did't have up to £45 cash.
Please avoid the Pegasus airline and look out for the staff who are criminals approaching people just before they board to collect any money claiming you have excess hand luggage .They don't give receipts and they don't want you to pay by card because I am sure some how they may be stealing some of the money.
Terrible airline avoid avoid.
The staff only approach you just before you board the plane, because they know there is nothing else you can do.
Why don't they come around and check hand luggage when everyone is sitting in the travel lounge before boarding, this is to show that they are out to make money.
I hope that all the information here will get to chief executive for review .

We were at the gate waiting for the bus to take us to the plane. When the gate was opened the airline officials started to check in our hand luggage to make sure that they were below 8 kg. They asked about twenty passengers to pay money in cash for the assumed extra weight.
They did not give any receipt and some passengers bargained with the team so they paid like 20 dollars instead of 100 and still no receipts.",12,"2016",3

Service on board is solution oriented, neither over friendly nor rude. Food and Beverages against a fee, but not really tasty. Be careful with the flex option, in case you have to take another flight you better cancel your ticket completely and book from scratch rather than changing the dates within the same booking, since you will be downgraded and lose 10kg of the extra baggage allowance etc. That part can be described as a ripp-off. Else if you need a cheap flight, go for it. Seating is not really a pleasure except you book on of the extra leg room seats which will grant you a bit more space, however the seats are the same.

"Pegasus-Airlines","comfortable and interesting","there was a TV screen that showed us where we are, how long we gonna land, the temperature, and the wind thats why it was interesting. and it also was very comfortable!
august 2016.",12,"2016",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","No frills...no legroom!","Pegasus is exactly what you will expect on a no frills airline: no legroom, if the person next to you is not skinny than is a bit of a wrestling, everything come at a price! But they take you from A to B normally on time and if it is a short flight this is OK.
I personally do not use no frills for anything longer than 2 hours.",12,"2016",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Never Again","Worst airline I have ever used, booked the package with the works, even the check in was a bad experience with rude staff - demanding to know why I had booked the expensive tickets when we didn't have the maximum weight luggage! The seats were uncomfortable, no leg room at all - and we were in the front row, no room in the overhead lockers for our hand luggage as the crew had filled them with their belongings. The cabin attendants were the worst I have ever come across, rude, disinterested and lazy - spent most of the flight just talking to each other, have never come across such bad airline staff. Our tickets came with meals, worst meals ever (and that is saying something for airline food), BUT we had to pay extra to have water with our meals! They refused to take cash of any currency for the water and would only take a credit card.",12,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Very good flight","Even so some of the reviews for Pegasus Airlines have been very bad, we still decided to go for the bargain offer.
Indeed, it is very recommandable to read all given information. Some tickets do include checked baggage. The limit is 20 Kg and it means 20 Kg. Likewise, carry-on is one piece at a maximum of 8 Kg. That is no mystery at all and more than clearly stated on the airlines website.
It is highly recommanded to pre-book seats at a reasonalbe extra charge, if you don't want to risk sitting in the middle seat.
On flights from Turkey to Europe, pre-purchase a meal at a very reasonable price. The meals we purchased were fresh and delicious. With all the extras, the flight was still a bargain.
The first leg from Antalya to Istanbul SAW was scheduled for 0855 am. Check-In was fast and friendly and the flight spot on time.
The transfer in Istanbul includes a bit of a walk and leaves with little time to enjoy the facilities (shops, restaurants, etc.)
The second led from Istanbul SAW to Hamburg was scheduled for 1145 am. Boarding started on time, however with 12 guests needing special assistance and a huge group of first time flyers, the 40 minute turn around for the aircraft was ambitious. The crew however was caring and friendly, while still getting the flight organized. We departed almost 30 minutes behind schedule. Thanks to the pilot, we landed in Hamburg only about 8 Minutes late.
Yes, it is a low cost, leisure airline. And no, it is not Turkish Airlines. Seating is tight, but accaptable. On both flights the aircraft was neat and clean and the crews very professional and friendly. They spoke fluent English and on the flight to Germany two also spoke German.
I am happy to choose Pegasus Airlines again in the future.",12,"2016",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst Airline we've ever used","When I booked our flights I had never heard of Pegasus Air. Our final destination was Sri Lanka but I booked the remaining legs with Etihad Air.

Pegasus had the right times of travel and it was an economy airline. Good price for a family of 4. I also purchased the extra package for a Carry On bag and a personal bag. I thought I'd read all the fine print and was good to go.

We are traveling the world for 18months. At the time we flew on Pegaus we were 2 1/2 months into our travels.

This is apparently a small airline with no online check in so we waited in the Manchester airport for an hour while they were checking in passengers and weighing bags, etc.

We each had 1 Carry on at 20kg each and 1 small personal bag each. Upon checking in the attendant was so focused on us being from America and Discussing our recent election of Donald Trump, that our entire check in process was a mess.

We have traveled with ONLY these 2 bags each on major and budget airlines from all over with ZERO Issues.

She had us weigh our carry on bags and insisted that they had to be under 8kg each to go on the plane. We started panicking because these are our entire life's possessions AND upon arrival in Doha Qatar, we had to run to catch our Etihad flight, again, which was booked separately, which meant that we would somehow need to run through customs, pay for visa's to get our bags and then go through security to get back into the airport and catch our flight..all within a 1 hour layover window.

I was panicking.

We had no choice. We had to give our bags. While she was checking them in, she continued on about Trump. I was so distracted by taking my computer out of my carry on and all of us had to rearrange some things that we needed with us that I forgot to insist on getting my baggage locator receipts.

I only realized this as we were mid flight on our first leg.

On the flight the attendants were very unfriendly. There was a yelling match between one passenger and a group on the other side of the aisle. the attendants were rolling their eyes a lot and they had zero smiles to offer.

At the Istanbul airport I called the company we booked the flights through and then the insurance claim office for our flights to see if we could change our next 2 flights so we'd have time to get our bags at Doha.

It would've cost us over $1200 to do so. We made the decision to roll the dice and see how things went.

We are not high maintenance people and are generally glass half full but I've never been so stressed out.

Can you imagine your entire family losing your bags. No receipt because the attendant was too busy trying to say why Trump was a very bad decision for America?

You have no idea what we had to go through at the Doha Airport to not only secure our bags and find them.

My entire family will never fly with Pegasus again.",12,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Uncomfortable normal flight","Flew from beirut to vienna .
Both flights were on time and the aircrafts were ok. Tiny legroom uncomfortable seats. Nothing special . Typically low cost airline . You get what you pay for. So if your a seeking for comfort it is definetly the wrong airline that you fly with.",11,"2016",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","""for every thing you have pay extra""","The seat spaces are so close and boring at around 4 hrs flight.For front seats must pay extra.food,water etc also extra.The cabin crew and pilots experienced .
you have to weigh your suitcases,hand luggages.even for 1kg you have to pay excess.They close early for excess payments via web.",11,"2016",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Dependable, but low-budget experience","I fly Pegasus often, living in Turkey. The experience is always the same, but the price keeps me flying. The most disappointing thing is that the flights are always stuffy and no beverages are served without cost, not even water. I think water ought to be a given for any flight over 2 hours. The service is always fine but it's like riding on a bus. If you have a few extra dollars, and it's an option, choose Turkish Air over Pegasus. If you have to fly Pegasus, buy water before you fly.",11,"2016",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Luggage tax before boarding","We were stopped before boarding by one Pegasus crew that came with a scale and waged our cabin luggage and asked us to pay 50 TYL for the extra wheith . They did not allow us to remove our things that we purchase from the duty free or laptop and did not allowed us to board widouth paying this tax. We did have more than the 8kg allowed but I never encountered this situation with any airline company that I flight with. Is outrages what happened and I will never fly with this company. This is rubbery. I mention that when we flied into Turkey with the same luggage they haven't charge it and it was OK but they charge the same luggage at the departure.",11,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","go to Sharm el Sheik","Well done to Pegasus airlines for re opening the way to Sharm el Sheik. We flew from Stansted to Sabiha Gokcen International Airport, Istanbul, then on to Sharm el Sheik. The flight from London was full and no frills but the seats were comfortable and the price good so no complaints - the pre ordered food in flight option appeared to be good value - the person next to me had pre ordered a meal and it looked OK. You can order snacks on the plane but they seemed a bit expensive. There is no in flight entertainment that I could see - screens above me but no headphones were offered - either for sale or free.
The flight on to Sharm el Sheik was almost half empty so most people got to sleep on two or three seats - good for us this time but a shame that more people are not going to Sharm el Sheik - the airport security is very good - our bags were all scanned before we were allowed out of the airport , despite being scanned by airport security in Istanbul.",11,"2016",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Better than you think","Better thank you think. for the amount you pay, you will not be looking for more than you get. I enjoyed the experience in general.",11,"2016",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Great company, do not miss the pre-ordered meals","I flew with the whole family from Turkey to Madrid. The Connections in the second airport of Iztanbul are ok but buy as little food or drinks at the airport. Pre-ordered meals in Pegasus are a great value especially the hot breakfast or cold breakfast. Seat have just enough legroom but the service is low (many assistants do not speak English properly). Likewise, the online help chat is terrible AND ONLY IN TURKISH. IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM YOU HAVE TO CONTACT IZTANBUL (and not for free!!).",11,"2016",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Low cost","On the 17th of April 2016 we flew by Pegasus. Searched tickets in advanced, about 5 weeks before flight. Reserved on line - very convenient and fast. Low cost is a plus, but 20 kg per person, no meals on board - minuses. Of course, for extra charge you may buy more kilos of luggage, meal, reserve better seat.
On time check-in, boarding and landing.
Would like to use only in some certain situations.",11,"2016",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","low price","low cost flight

"Pegasus-Airlines","Check the small letters!","I booked this flight with LastMinute.com It was written in the first flight ""1 piece of hold luggage included weighing 20kg"", and in return flight it was written ""1 piece of hold luggage included"". After check-in in Barcelona, when the boarding began, thay called me and I paid additional 75 Euros for 3 pieces of luggage.
The planes were enough modern, but not clean...",11,"2016",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","You know what you pay for","The problem of this flight was the delay. We had a round trip via Istanbul, and ve waited 2 hours at least for 3 flights of 4 ones. The plane was clean and new enough.",11,"2016",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Never again","Pegasus is a Turkish based airline with their ‘hub’ in Istanbul, Turkey.

They have flights that go as wide as Manchester in the UK, Madrid in Spain, Dehli in India and Oslo in Sweden.

Most of the time Pegasus would offer you a very affordable flight ticket … BUT!!! Before you purchase a Flight ticket with this airline, consider the following:

You may only take 20kg travel luggage and 8kg hand luggage (you vcan book extra luggage, but its EXPENSIVE!!!)

No meal or drink is included in your ticket price. You have to purchase your food on the plain (remember to have Euros)

Space is very limited on these aircrafts

Generally the air hostesses come across rude because they cant speak english.

Small delays with this airline seems to be standard procedure??

No TV and/or onboard entertainment

Dodgy aircons ; extremely humid, hot and uncomfortable in the aircraft

Overall rating 2/10

Rather stick with Star Aliance partners!",11,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Always a bad experience!!","Since Pegasus is the only airline provides most often services from Sabiha Gokcen SAW i often have to resort to their services. But always a disappointment! Unless if you pay the extra cost during online checkin for a seat with extra space you get stuck with seats that have no space at all! Food/beverages even the smallest bottle of water is for a fee on board. Adding onto that really bad customer service to top it all. If there were any other options, would never fly with pegasus and wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",11,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","No complaints","We flew Pegasus from Prague to Istanbul and back. I have no complaints - what you see is what you get. Nothing special whatsoever but when travelling on a low cost airline you don't want to have any unnecessary delays or other mishaps. There were none related to the airline. The problem is that the airport - Sabiha Gokcen - is far from the city and traffic is terrible. We arrived in the evening. Travel time from the airport to the city was close to 3 hours. Leaving was much quicker, about an hour as traffic was not a problem.",10,"2016",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","What flight times???","We seemed to spend as much time on the tarmac as we did flying! Be prepared to find most Turkish passengers pay less for their tickets by not using the normal aircraft hold .but carry all their luggage onto the plane and either spend forever trying to cram it all in the over head lockers..If your sat in the aisle seats expect a few knocks and bruises not twice but four times .stansted .Istanbul.again Istanbul then Ercan.they are out of their seats in a flash so please be aware and prepared..For me never again!",10,"2016",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Average","Actually it is low cost airline with very low or no services.Airline sells foods and drinks but with high price. I recommended that just for short flight.",10,"2016",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","It was crazy!","As I had a transit flight from Rome to Ankara through Istanbul, it was necessary for me to be in time for the second flight. But the first one was delayed for more than an hour and I had to run a lot not to miss my plane. The planes were old, the staff didn't look very friendly and helpful, but the luggage was safe, thanks God! Food and drinks on board are for extra price, but not expensive.",10,"2016",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Not a good experience","Where to start, safety checks not carried out effectively ie seat belts not fastened,seats not upright,tables not stowed, electronic devices in use and people wandering around opening lockers during takeoff and landing. Countless delays partially because flight was overbooked,left sitting on the plane for over 2 hours at Istanbul with very little information with people arguing loudly over seating a thoroughly unpleasant experience.Never again will I fly this route or with this airline. The return flight was equally unpleasant with the additional problem of damaged seating.",10,"2016",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Better to avoid","low cost airline with very low or no services , destroyed luggage , no reaction.
If compare with other airlines flying the same routing, Pegasus fares are not cheaper , sometimes even much more expensive. My luggage was destroyed , lost and found at arrival Tbilisi did not even open a damage report, they said that Pegasus not allow to do this. I have sent a mail to the customer services, NO REPLY at all, avoid this airline !!",10,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Pegasus is horrible!","Was catching a connecting flight at Istanbul Airport and was told we arrived at gate 2 minutes late. The plane was still boarding, yet we were told it was too late and would have to buy a ticket for the next flight. The staff was extremely rude and unreasonable. In addition, they tried to charge us almost $1000 US dollars for a 1 way ticket to Amsterdam. We were able to purchase a ticket with Turkish Air for $253. I vehemently suggest you avoid Pegasus Airlines!",10,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Delayed delayed delayed with no explanation","We had two flights and both were delayed for 1 hour each without any announcement they just leave u wait, no respect for passengers and their time",10,"2016",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Disgraceful attitude towards less able passengers","The cabin crews on this CHEAP (not budget) airline have a disgraceful attitude toward people with disabilities.
On my flight out to Ercan I was unhappy with their attitude but put it down to them ""having a bad day"", but on my return flight I was disgusted. As a wheelchair user who can walk only very slowly with poor balance I had help from the airport's assistance teams, who are excellent. But once inside the aircraft you are treated like a necessary inconvenience.
I had to be lifted from my seat by my companion to stand and the cabin crew could see how difficult this was for me. At Istanbul we understood we would stay seated while passengers left and new ones boarded for Stansted, when suddenly a cabin crew member just shouted that everone was to leave. Everyone was confused, asking why and should we take hand luggage with us. First no, leave your things, then yes, take your things. People were shouted at in badly broken English with no explanation, just raised voices and hands.
Besides myself there were three other elderly passengers with poor mobility. After moving slowly toward the front of the cabin they were ordered to sit down again, then get up to leave, then again sit down. My companion tried to explain we were unable to manage the steps and the response was a barked order to ""just sit down"". I shouted back saying I am unable to just sit anywhere. There were many staff by this point at the rear of the cabin obviously searching the plane for something which was concerning but not one person took time to explain to the disabled passengers what was happening, or if help was coming to get us off.
Then a cabin crew member started shouting again in Turkish at which point I raised my voice and reminded her that we were English speaking passengers, and didn't understand a word she was saying. Her attitude was disgraceful as she begrudgingly told me in barely understandable English that there was a technical problem that was being mended. Not very reassuring for disabled passengers unable to leave without help.
Then suddenly she was having a ""heated discussion"" with one of the elderly passengers sitting down, again in Turkish. They were ordered to stand and virtually herded with the other two back toward their seats, as I was told to sit down in my seat, the problem was fixed and the other passengers were waiting to board. Had I not had my companion to hold back the boarding passengers while I struggled to get into my seat I could easily have been knocked over. Just one crew member, a male steward, showed some concern, to the rest we were an inconvenience.
I will NEVER fly with Pegasus airlines again and would advise anyone with reduced mobility to avoid them like the plague.",10,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Abusive drunken passengers not dealt with.","We don't expect much on this airline but this was the worst flight ever . Two English louts of middle age got onto the plane clearly the worst for drink, shouting etc. They verbally abused an old Turkish man. Kicking his chair and saying he had smelly feet. I told him off for swearing etc and he threatened to put me in a hole. I am an older lady. The stewardess did absolutely nothing. The man were drinking their own whisky they'd bought on to the place which is forbidden.many English passengers told her to,take some action.....call security, land etc. She did nothing but move the old man to,a nearby seat. Terrible. We felt so ashamed to be British. I will complain to,the airline as this is unacceptable and ask for compensation. They have a duty of care to us",10,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Scam & rude airline","I flew from Germany to Dubai with a stop in turkey on Pegasus airline. The planes are dirty, noisy, and the staff is very very rude. In turkey about 5 minutes before closing the gate a staff member came to me demanding $90.00 to allow me to continue my flight to Dubai. The $90.00 demand according to the rude staff is for my over weight hand bag which was perfectly fine in Germany. They did this purposely to pressure me to pay. If I was allowed to board from Germany in same airline why did they make trouble in turkey. I learned from the rest of passengers it was done to them. One Russian lady was crying and said they forced her to pay 200 euros. I asked the staff what If i bought something from the airport what will happen. No answer. They do this on purpose only in turkey to steal from transit customers. Never again this thief airline. Never again transit in turkey.",10,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","First time using Pegasus Airlines","I used Pegasus flights for the first time in September of this year, was a bit nervous as reading previous comments on different sites they did not have a good reputation. I can certainly say that flights both ways departed and landed on time. Staff were very professional and friendly. I will use the airline again. They are also a lot cheaper than the other main airlines.",10,"2016",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Far exceeded our expectations","The reviews for Pegasus Airlines on the whole were bleak but because we did not have an international connection we took a chance, we were so glad we did! The check in staff were friendly and helpful, the flight left on time, our pre ordered meal was far better than we expected, the cabin staff friendly and best of all super cheap! We paid extra for extra baggage allowance (because we were on an international flight coming into Istanbul) this gave us the option of choosing our seats and an inflight meal however we didn't pay much more This is a budget airline with budget planes but it is very good value for money.",10,"2016",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","So relaxed","Check in for Pegasus at Stansted has always been very smooth and fast. The planes are comfortable and the aircrew are not like mini Hitlers unlike some other airlines!
Return flight from Turkey you would think will only be half full, however the flight starts in Northern Cyprus so there will always be people on the plane before you.",10,"2016",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Best thing was flights on time","Having paid an exorbitant amount of money to pre book seats, we booked row 1 as you tend to get extra leg room and do not like being in middle of plane. First leg we got our pre booked seats but had less legroom than on any budget airlines normal seat and seats were small and uncomfortable, 2nd leg we didn't and all we got out of staff in Istanbul send email for refund....... sorry not good enough. However, on our return journey we did get our pre booked seats on both flights, and as the plane was a newer one we did have the extra legroom. Appreciate this is a Turkish airline however, the English translation of Safety etc., was total rubbish.

The only good thing I can say is that all flights where on time.",10,"2016",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Did as they said on the Tin","Flew from Stansted to Ercan(Lefkosa)
Flight arrived 40 mins late and we sat on the tarmac at Stansted for nearly an hour with no explanation.
Flight to Istanbul was fine, legroom and seat comfort better than most UK Charter Airlines.
I Pre Ordered my In-Flight Meal which was fine.
Landed at Istanbul for Cabin Crew Change,Refuelling,Washroom clean and random Passport Inspection while some Passengers disembarked and others joined.
Seemed to spend 20 minutes waiting in a queue to get on the Runway due to the Airport Runway being busy. Quick 40 minute hop to Cyprus
Pretty much the same on the return....having done this Journey on Onur Air and Tailwind the previous 3 times this was more comfortable and the Crew were happy and helpful.",10,"2016",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Average","Being a budget airline, the flight was OK. Even though the flight was from Oslo to Dubai with a stop in Istanbul, I could only check-in online from Oslo to Istanbul using a PC. The mobile app, however, only allowed check-in from Istanbul to Dubai, but never worked. Overall, the flight was fine, with three negatives:
1. Too hot in the airplane. The air went had too little pressure and I was sweating all the way. So did other passengers I talked to.
2. The in-plane announcements were of course in Turkish and English. But due to terrible accent, it was impossible to recognize when the Turkish part was over and the English part started, even then it was extremely difficult to understand what they were saying. That was case with ALL the announcements made by captain and the crew.
3. Boarding was on time, but the flight took off almost an hour late.",10,"2016",3

No one care, no one explained any reason. At turkey SERDAN one of the ground staff through a mobile at me, shout to me in turkish and came out of the desk to come to hit me..after this no one care , seems like a normla situation and the staff is very rude, laugh at people, they have no respect no ven speaks English...I have been transferred to a another plane to Barcelona...then I got a train to reach madrid. After sending around 50 emails 2 weeks in advance before my way back to ask for the refund of the money and cancellation of the way back..they ignore the emails..for every 3 question they reply what they want..even telling them about going for legal way they still don't care. ..PLEASE DON'T FLY WITH THEM.",10,"2016",1

"Pegasus-Airlines","Never got the promised refund.","Pegasus is a Turkish company with knock-down rates. Maybe their planes have flown without crashing (so far), but their reputation definitely has not.
This company still owes me money due to a cancelled flight. Never saw anything. The story:

There was a coup attempt in Turkey on 16 July 2016. One day later I was about to have a transfer through Istanbul with Pegasus. But the airports were shut down. Via their website, Pegasus offered a full refund, for which I enlisted and got a confirmation.

That was the last thing I heard from them. E-mail enquiries go unanswered. There is a call centre in my home country (Netherlands), but that does sales only. They seem have to have no formal establishment outside Turkey. It looks to me they reckon that it is not worthwhile for customers to start a legal procedure across the border.

Probably I have just lost my money to them. What a scam operation!",10,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Mediocre airline","Although the price for the tickets was like a regular flight it seems like the company is low cost...

Had a connection in Istanbul, meaning 2:15 of flight time to Istanbul and then 2:45 of flight time to Prague. No meal was served. Even mineral water should be purchased and the prices are... let's say not your local store ones..

Each and every flight was delayed at least 30 minutes. In total had 4 flights with this company, to Prague with connection in Istanbul and then back again via Istanbul.

Not sure I'll fly with this company again.",10,"2016",3

"Pegasus-Airlines","Another bad experience with a Turkish airline","After being delayed by almost 3hrs flying from Kayseri to Istanbul with Anadolujet, my husband and I missed the last flight of the day home to Stansted airport London with Pegasus airlines. We had to purchase more tickets for the next morning's flight at 10:25, which cost over 8 times more than our original tickets. We had to stay in the Airport hotel and had to buy a meal. We arrived 2 hours early to check in for the morning flight and were told that there was only one seat left (we needed 2), even though we had paid over £1000 for a one way flight! We were told that we would have to wait for the next flight in the evening at 20:40.The company told us to wait at the desk, which we did until 30 mins before the flight departure, when we were hurriedly told we were on the flight, given tickets and to go to the departure gate. We had a stressful time trying to sort out where our bags were and whether they would be on the plane. We were assured they would be.There was no further help given. Istanbul SAW airport is ridiculously overcrowded and very badly organised. The queues to get through passport control were extremely long and not moving, so my husband ran around trying to find out how to get through passport control faster. We were pointed to the Fast Track queue by some travellers. This was almost as long as the ordinary queue and still not moving. Some travellers said we had to buy a Fast Track ticket or we could not get through. Apparently, you bought them from a Turkish Delight shop! We bought them but on telling the staff at the Fast Track desk that our flight would be leaving in 15 mins they were very unhelpful and just said we had to ask everyone in the queue if we could go to the front. The abuse we got was awful. The passport officer was also very slow and then we had to get through security, which of course we didn't and the alarms went off. They do go off for everyone though and they let us through after being frisked. There was no indication where the gate was to catch the plane and I found a member of staff who pointed it out. We kept hearing the tannoy saying something about Stansted London but it was very difficult to make it out. It was the farthest gate in the airport and we ran for 10 mins to reach it. We were completely exhausted and I couldn't talk by the time we reached the gate. The doors were shut but staff were there. They let us on the plane. We weren't sat together but it didn't matter.The plane took off 35 mins late. The whole experience completely ruined an otherwise great holiday and we will remember it for the bad experience coming home. Having told several people on our return, the attitude has been that they have been put off Turkey anyway with all the terrorism but our experience has made them resolute that they do not want to visit Turkey at all. It is a shame but we will never go again to an otherwise great destination.",9,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","affordable Flight","Great experience with Pegasus airlines in Turkey, Beside I have enjoyed during my flight in the airplane.",9,"2016",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Oh Boy! How do I put this delicately! Read, might save your trip.","I read tonnes of negative reviews about this airlines, and people warning me to avoid, but I said hey, its 300 dollars cheaper than the alternative flight, I am sure the savings are worth it. Spoiler alert, I was wrong.

Here's everything that went wrong:

1. Flight gets delayed 1 hour 10 minutes straight before checking in.
2. Flight get delayed extra 15 minutes to take off airport.
3. Flight gets delayed 15 extra minutes to land.
4. I had a 2 hour window of transit, I ran like hell in the airport to catch my connection, I made it because the connection also gets delayed :)
5. Connection flight gets delayed 45 minutes to take off.
6. I reach my destination, but my checked in luggage doesn't arrive.

On my way back:

7. Flight gets delayed 1 hour just standing in the runway!

About the plane itself:

1. Planes are dirty.
2. Horrible seats.
3. Forget about the service inside.
4. Overpriced items (a 300 ml water bottle for Euro 1.5)

Look, if you really need to make the savings, I get it. But make sure you have at least 3 hours transit window so at least you have a good chance to catch your connection and your checked in luggage makes it through. There will always be delays.

This is by far the worst airline I have ever been on, and this is coming from someone who have tried lots of budget airlines. So make sure you know what you are doing before booking.",9,"2016",1

"Pegasus-Airlines","Uncomfortable Seating","The seating arrangements are far too cramped. I am only 5ft 6 in and was totally unable sleep at all . Having to wake at 3am, to catch my flight I was in dire need to rest properly.and the small narrow seats, with inadequate leg space, was the sole cause of this. Like many of the other passengers, I had to be fresh, to ensure my drive home was safe, by being well rested.",9,"2016",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","All was ok","All was ok. Night flight. nobody disturb. I did not request any meal, cant say anything. Just may be note, that prices for meal which you can request upon booking the same as prices on the aircraft during your flight. So no need to book it beforehand if you not sure about.",9,"2016",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Excellent for the price","We were very happy with the flight,staff members very polite and smiley ,nice food for reasonable price and the most important thing is that we had good comfort for the 4 hours flight 😜.There vere no delays and yes I would recommend Pegasus Airlaine!",9,"2016",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Always delayed!","Both my flights were delayed over 1.5 hour! Outbound reason was given as air traffic at destination airport.
On Return flight they didn't even bother to explain the reason for delay. On both flights they kept us waiting in the plane without air conditioner being turned on. When I asked I was told they would have to wait until engineers were turned on. Needless to say it was boiling hot and no offer of water to cool us off.
The legroom is the tightest I've ever seen and I'm only 5.3, so imagine how a person with an average height would fit in.
The stewardess speak very poor English. I'll never fly with this airline again. My friends and family also experienced the same issues even with domestic flights. The long unexplained delays being the main reason.
Long queues at bag drop off too. Soft drinks terribly expensive. I guess this covers it all.",9,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Flights are fine for price","We flew Stanstead to Istanbul and then onto Elazig return journey Elazig - Istanbul onto Stanstead. At every stage the flights were delayed take off in Stanstead was delayed and connecting flight was delayed slightly - return journey flight was delayed and connecting flight also delayed. The actual flight was fine but delays seem to be the norm.",9,"2016",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Transit in Turkey","It's a blow budget company and as far as the flight, it was ""ok"" but when you need information while you are in transit, the costumer service is NOTHING.",9,"2016",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Pegasus earns gold medal for the most aweful service!","This airline offers cheap tickets, even though the price has risen over the past few years. I've had several flight with them until the last time that I promised to stop this forever. We were kept inside the airplane for about two hours before the airplane takes off. When passengers were asking to go out and get some fresh air, the stewards were refusing and even worse were shouting at poor passengers. This wasn't enough, but they decided to take advantage of the situation to sell food. Business comes first!
Finally, they did not even apologize for keeping people inside the airplane for such long time. I guess it's something very normal with this airline.",9,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst airline disgusting service!!!","worst airline DO NOT BOOK WITH PEGASUS YOU WILL REGRET IT they dont care about their passengers none of them can speak english and the ones that can speak a little they dont help with queries if you pay for food for your flight they wont give it on the day !! Dry food is disgusting waste of your money service is just ridiculous the workers are rude and not professional at all i will never recommend anyone to use pegasus they also mess up your flight information and get everything messed up best advice stick to british airlines wouldnt even give them a 1/10 thats how bad they are !!",9,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Cheap, so do it!","Completely without frills such as food, luggage or TV, it's excellent value for money. The planes I went on (4 of) were 737-800's which have reasonable room and very good comfort. Optional sandwiches were excellent and reasonably priced, coffee wasn't horrible.
Trolly dollies were very polite and professional, smiles were genuine and all spoke excellent English.
I really cannot fault Pegasus for value, they're better than eg. Easyjet, by a long way.",9,"2016",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Delays","We were delayed an hour going out and 2 hours on return,
Flight attendants were not friendly or helpful going out. Everything that was asked of them they didn't know",9,"2016",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","AWFUL","Awful from start to finish - delays every time I fly with them - staff don't know anything. I am going to complain but if their customer service is anything like their flight service I don't hold any hope.",9,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","AWFULLLLLLL","awfull smell ...can't even breath....so bad bad toilet smell ...i just complain few times with the hostess...was something that i never see before in 40 years of flights....they took a note...i almost be vomiting",9,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Basic","Having flown on holiday with Thomas Cook, which was still quite a basic, aged plane, the flight back was booked through Pegasus. Check in was slapdash and poorly managed, when on the plane itself, the staff were quite discourteous and rude, and was hugely uncomfortable (partly down to my height..). The transit was through Istanbul, which was delayed with no information on any ETA or updates at any point. I will certainly re-evaluate travel options for the next trip.

One distinct reason for the 2 stars was that my luggage arrived in one piece, apposed to many on here.",9,"2016",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Very cold","When I say very cold i'm talking about the cabin crew. Not being good with foreigners they seem happy to speak with those who have the same mother tongue but when it comes to another they don't seem to 'understand' too well and certainly did not have a smile.
So all in all cabin crew could be alot warmer towards passengers needs.
The actual flights ok can't really say too much about that, just that when captain speaks it's nigh on difficult to understand what's being said over the intercom.
So flights ok for the price othe stuff could be better.",9,"2016",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","So nice to fly with Pegasus Airlines .","I flew from Alb. to Antalya and they were so perfect staff in everything .But need to do more and take in consider the save of luggage .",9,"2016",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Value for money","I had really good flight. Everything was on time. Cabin crew was polite. I will definitely fly with them again.",9,"2016",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Good flight","Really pleasant flight. I was surprise. Really professional stuff members. The planes where really good and comfortable.",9,"2016",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Late in outbound and inbound. Without clarification.","the take off from Beirut was delayed 30 minutes. in the connecting airport - Istanbul we set 1 hour on the runway before take off, then arrived 1 hour late to Paris. when coming back we arrived late to Istanbul it was 30 minutes before my flight to Beirut then setting in the plane for 1 hour 30 minutes before take off. And the staff will not give you any information about what's happening.",9,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","cheap and basic flight. you get what you pay for...","Transit flight, actually. Tel Aviv-->Istanbul-->Budapest. 2 hour connection at Istanbul main airport. all in all, the flight was uneventful, courteous and smiling flight attendants. other than that, you pay for everything extra. they wouldn't even serve water on board, unless you pay for mineral water. however, I did get hungry on the second flight (Istanbul-Budapest) and ordered a sandwich with coke. the sandwiches are rather on the small side, so take that into consideration. I would advise buying food before the flight, so as to not get hungry on board. also, the boarding procedure has been consistently delayed by at least 20 minutes. I see other negative comments on this airline, but i really think that getting you from point A to B via the air, at close to half the price of national airlines, is bound to have downsides in relation to the big leagues, right? you can't buy a product or service at half price and expect highest quality or be treated like royalty. just my view on things... have a pleasant trip, anyway, and remember: it is not the flight that counts, but the vacation itself. I just think that the destination i am going to should be the thing i am spending money on...",9,"2016",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Tehran, Istanbul, Amsterdam","This flight is well known for travelers who would like fly from a European capital to Tehran or vise versa!
It is famous for cheap price, that is why you don't have to expect so much.
I think the airfare is reasonable but wish that company have more changes, especially:
- 20 kg luggage limitation is so low.
- Turkish crews in Sabiha Gokcen are not polite mostly especially when you have flight from Istanbul toward W-Europe; they act you like a terrorist if you don't have European passport! So annoying!",9,"2016",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Pleasant experience","What more could you ask for on the budget airline!

They were on time, clean, professional and friendly with their service!

I enjoyed the one flight, I will go with them again!",9,"2016",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","WORST AIRLINES EVER!!!!!!!!!","Me and my wife came back from London to turkey, because of 3 KG extra. We got charged 70 pounds, besides we had to leave some of our clothes at the airport. So embarrassing and stressful time. We were just about to lose my flight and the stuff only laughing at us and pushing us to drop off more weight out of our caring bag. Horrible personals, bad attitude and not helpful at all, if you read this review never and ever use cheap flight. pay little more and respect your comfort.",9,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Don't fly with Pegasus Airlines they are terrible.","I have had a truly bad experience of Pegasus. I flew from Istanbul to Athens, Greece Intl Airport (ATH) one year ago but my luggage was lost - I filled out a lost baggage report when I landed and have been trying to contact them since - by telephone, email and through their website but have had no response. My luggage is still lost, one year they are not taking any responsibility from lost luggage
DON’T FLY WITH THEM.",9,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","just terrible","we don't judge a service perfectly done on normal conditions. a service is evaluated on how things are handled for abnormal situations: a total failure with unexperienced staff and careless management.
imposed 1 hr delay from antalya, we arrived to istanbul at10:50 pm ,20 min before schedule to the connection to beirut. we went to the first pegasus office on the transfer area to help us find the gate, he informed us the gate was closed already !!!! they did not try to check again. with 2 babies it was just terrible. assigning us a hotel to spend the night to wait for the morning flight was considered by them a favor. sometimes it sounded as if we were working for them or as if we were beggers. the staff are just impolite, disrespectful, rude...
our surprise was on the departure board after all that: the plane that they told us we could not catch did not leave before 11:55pm (after 1hr of our arrival to saw). So what really happened? We weren't explained.
And the biggest surprise, after the delay of 40min in the morning flight they put us on, was that our luggage were in Beirut since the day before...
i can't express enough disapointment.",9,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Late, dirty, surly staff","I have flown Pegasus for many years and experienced their decline first hand. In the last three years only one flight has made it on time and the scheduled flight times have been unmercifully massaged but they still fail. This latest flight was delayed, as usual. On boarding, the cabin was filthy and the staff their usual officious unhelpful selves. Toilets were locked for no other reason than the convenience of the staff despite out being incarcerated on it for 9 hours. No apologies were offered at any point. We sent our lift home as it was so late and incurred the expense of a taxi. Pegasus has got it very wrong, instead of new aircraft and routes they should concentrate on offering service on the oneS they have. I won't be using them again",9,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Best budget airline","Flying with pegasus was brilliant! The rates are much cheaper than other airlines serving the same places, additionally you get so many benefits! The booking process is relatively straightforward and simple, but the app is not that great. You can check in online or at the airport for no extra cost! You can even use the self service kiosk to beat the lines if you have no luggage to drop! The seats are the padded and soft and even recline! And best of all you can carry a cabin size luggage and a backpack on board, which other budget airlines won't let you do. Also they give you 15kg checked baggage allowance for free! Even though I didn't try their food it is relatively cheap! Only downside is that they sometimes experience delays of 1-2 hours. But overall if you are flying to turkey, cut the price tag as pegasus is the way to go!",9,"2016",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Budget service","Sadly Pegasus are not cheap to fly to North Cyprus, yet the provide no meals or drinks free despite the high cost of travel. Staff are not particularly frienfly. The announcements are spoken unclearly in Turkish. In English they speak with Yurkishaccents and speed with incorrect pace and accent and no commas thus a string of waffle.
Cost of inflight meals are a rip off too.
A lady in the verge of passing out was refused water as the hostess asked who will pay for it. Then they weakly asked uf there was a foctor on board and made no attempt to comfort the old lady.
Seats are dirty. The inly plus is that the pilots are good and land smoothly.",9,"2016",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Not a customer focussed airline........","Found check in process an absolute mess. Despite purchasing my tickets in advance , I was told at check-in that my seat will be allocated at the gate. I had never experienced this with any other airline.
Meals were tasteless and no vegetarian option. Seats were like those you find at a council office , no idea why comfort is not on the agenda for this airline.
Overall found them to be over priced for such short European journeys with zero focus on customer services.",9,"2016",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","No more Pegasus for me or my family","Booked a flexible flight ticket for my wife from Almaty. When I did change the flights they charged me another 1,161TL for doing so. In spite of Pegasus' claim to be a low cost airline I would strongly challenge that statement. When you wish to make a complaint about anything you have to go through so many hoops to talk to somebody. When you do there seems to be a total lack of interest by the people retrieving the call. I have a similar problem when brand new luggage of mine was damaged on s flight from Tehran. No apology and no offer to put the matter right. Pegasus seem more interested in sending you a stream of emails trying to get you to book extra services that are not required or are ridiculously priced. In future I will only deal with the professions like Turkish Airlines and Atlasjet. Absolute rubbish,.",9,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Excellent budget airlines","Best budget economy flight! Comfortable seats better than ryanair and easyjet, the seats recline and are foam padded. Easy to navigate their website, and they have various services that make checking in easy and fast. You can check in online, at the airport and also get your boarding pass printed for now extra cost! Best of all they don't hassle you for carrying a backpack and a cabin size luggage onboard! Although I haven't tried their food, the prices are very reasonable! You get flight updates and reminders for no extra cost! Tbh if you are flying to Turkey from London, cut the price tag as pegasus is the way to go! Great stuff for great price!",9,"2016",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Not the best- 19/09/16 5173","At the airport in DAL check in www a total nightmare. There were 6 Pegasus desks with only one being for the Manchester flight and the others empty. They then made 3 desks available, after serving 2families they cut the third meaning everyone in that que had to join the back of the other que. huge waste of time. Took over an hour and a half to get checked in.

On the plane our pre-booked hot breakfast came out fridge cold. A mouthful of cold scrambled egg is not what you want at 6.30 am. They re heated it, no apology or anything. And came out dry and a little scorched.

Whilst my husband and I were asleep in seat 1a and 1b they took a completely unopened bottle of water from the compartment in front and then all the cabin staff denied doing so. Basically said we were liars to my face. I know staff are keen to clear away rubbish but throwing items that are not rubbish is unfair.",9,"2016",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Greatly Impressed","Great Service, especially as my 93 year old mother was with me. I felt the staff took good care in a genuine way. I did not much of an appetite, but the food was fine. The best about the airline - certainly that flight was the seamless way that my mother's mobility issue was taken care of. Full marks!",9,"2016",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Disappointed","I bought this ticket as I was on a budget however I was disappointed by a number of things during my journey. The comfort level was expected, having only paid £160 for a flight from London to Dubai but they did not accept dirhams which was outrageous considering I had taken off from Dubai. I paid £6 for a rock-hard Sandwich - unacceptable. There was also no in flight entertainment but this was expected.",9,"2016",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","low quality","the flight sometimes does not have a really helpful crew . also it does not have any variety and quality for foods. the plane is a little small . but the light shine is colorful and nice.",9,"2016",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Wet luggage, I mean soaking wet","Pegasus is a good airline in principle but employs very very very poor business partners. Cartrawler is a disaster to begin with, Up on arrival in Bologna, their agent refused to give us our car based on the non existence of an international driving license. With the same local license I rented my car from the next door agency and drove it a week with no problems. Their ground handling company in Bologna is late in bringing in the buses but very good in making orr luggage soaking wet and keeping the flight into a good 30 min delay. Turkish do&co owned partly by Pegasus' main competitor Turkish airlines is an excellent supplier of aged sandwiches. I still fly Pegasus as I live on the Asian side of Istanbul and the nearest airport SAW is Pegasus' hub but expect less and less every time.",9,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Terrible company- never on time","2 hour delay on outward leg from LGW to Istanbul means we missed our connection and flew out only the next day to Egypt. The next day we took our flight which also had an over 2 hour delay. Worth noting that every single Pegasus flight on the departure board that evening had over an hour delay (i checked, i was bored). They also managed to lose our suitcase and send it on another plane going in a complete different direction, and we didn't get our suitcase back for 6 days!!!
On the way back, same issue, 2 hours delay meant we missed our connecting flight in Istanbul for London, yeay, another day spent in Istanbul.
Why they schedule transfers under two hours, let alone 1 hour is mind boggling. worst airline i have ever had the displeasure of flying with. NEVER AGAIN!!!!!",9,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Average","Dubai to Amsterdam Via Istanbul

First flight from Dubai to Istanbul: Aircraft was new and clean! It was a usual flight however I was shocked when the staff told me around 2.5 hours into the flight that drinking water was over! we still had 1 hour 15 minutes remaining.

Second Flight from Istanbul to Amsterdam: Aircraft was very old and not clean. It was a difficult 3 hours 15 minutes flight. The landing was the most horrible I have ever had! not sure if the pilot is to be blamed.

The prices Pegasus offers are too enticing to avoid!",9,"2016",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","4 delayed flight nightmare with lost bag NEVER AGAIN - WORST AIRLINE EVER","BE VERY CAREFUL with Pegasus. All is not as it seems when you book . here are the things to consider when booking that made my trip an utter nightmare

1. When booking they said I was travelling from london to sharm via istanbul. In fact one day before the actual flight they announced on a text that i would ALSO be stopping at Hurghada .

2. ALL flights I took with them were very delayed . One connecting flight landed at 7.12 for a 7.30 connecting flight. 1 hour delays are standard with these people... dont let the '20 min ' delay sign fool you.

3. nowhere on my booking online or in member area did it give me any idea what my landing times were. this makes booking taxis a total nightmare. calls to their hotline are a waste of time. during the flights the cabin crew told me the flight would take an hour more than the pilot. No one really knows. its mind boggling.

4. on flights overnight between 2 am and 5 am they leave the lights on full and the cabin crew bash around trying to serve meals. you will not get any sleep.

5. they lost my bag. no apology for the delays . no apology for losing £4k of dive kit. they literally couldnt care less

6. the website is a disaster and many dead links. nothing works, the tel numbers are often wrong and they NEVER respond to emails.

7. they dont really fly an A to B route like everyone else. they basically fly a giant round robin loop of 4 or 5 airports in a giant loop. what this means is without warning you could be flown back to stanstead instead of gatwick at their whim, you will land at random airports and wait on the tarmac while some people get off and some get on. hand luggage coming on and off in these circumstances is poorly checked and the opportunity for a terrorist to leave a bag on the plane and get off is obvious. youll also be turfed out at different airports on the way to stand on the tarmac and re identify your baggage that youve allready checked in. on one occasion i frantically ran from a Pegasus plane to get the next connection ( having asked cabin crew what to do as the flight was running so late ..they simply shrugged and said if you miss the flight go to the desk ) i ran through the airport and round to the gate only to find I got back on the SAME PLANE i had just got off. there is no consistency here at all. It actually feels like you are in a vindictive reality TV show where the joke is on you.

im 5ft 7 and there is zero legroom. The prices for food and drink are mindblowing and despite being a turkish airline they have a major issue accepting their own currency ! the aircraft are tatty and dirty and have broken seats.

I will never ever ever ever use this stupid excuse for a flying bus route again.",9,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Low cost, lower quality","I fly with Pegasus almost every month both domestic and international because they are one of the two airway company which connects the city I study to the city my family lives. And Pgs is cheaper compared to the other. I also used them a lot to go international. However, in overall I cannot say that I am happy about the service. Frequent delays, non-professional customer services, unfriendly cabin crew...",9,"2016",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Cheap tickets, smileless employees","I flew from Belgrade to Istanbul several times with Pegasus (short flight, about 1.5 hours) but wouldn't go for a longer flight with them. Food is very pricey and not good, no entertainment on the flights and their employees never smile. On the other hand, low prices all year long. All in all, good value for the money you pay. One more thing, tall people - good luck!",9,"2016",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Another delayed flight","They are not getting better, if anything they are getting worse. On a recent flight, the plane was dirty with orange segments and empty bottles on the floor. Someone else was sat on my pre booked and pre paid seat, and when we approached the harassed hostess, she said sort it out amongst yourselves. Look for an alternative flight.",9,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Complaint about bad behavior from bording crew","Pegasus airlines is a very bad company with a very rude crew staff. All the crew staff and especially two crew women's (Megan and Sturden) at the boarding gate 201 A , the flight number was 858 on 10-9-2016 at 10:30 pm. The flight was from Istanbul to Kuwait. One of them Megan charged me 522 T for nothing. She treated me very rudely and not fairly. I didn't have extra weight and I showed her my insluin injection bag. She weghted my carry bags and there wasnt any extra weight at all! The two small carry bags weight was 15 kg only for me and my daughter!! She said to me rudely you have to pay for 5 kilos or I will let the plane leave without you!!!She closed the door and told me I will let the airplane leave without you. She told me rudely throw 5 kilos of your new cloths and I let you go to the plane!!she let us throw our food that we just bought from the airport on the floor that has a 5 kilo as she said!!!

She treated me unfairly. She let all the passengers with heavy luageges without charging them. She and the other crew women shouted to me rudely!!

She treated me unfairly. She let all the passengers with heavy carry bags borad without charging them. After paying the money Megan, Sturden and a man (from crew staff) and the other crew women shouted to me rudely!!and they laughed loudly after paying the money while I leave to the airplane!

This situation affect my health conditions and I was very sick for two days...",9,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Pegasus Airlines","I recently made an online reservation from Australia, for my son to travel from Dubai to Berlin (via Istanbul).The initial contact with Pegasus Airlines was via an online """"Best Fare"" search.I was hesitant at first,but from the initial booking,to payment,additional services request and online check-in / boarding pass - the whole experience was GREAT.The flights were ontime and connecting flights were all good.The staff at both Dubai and Istanbul were helpful and luggage checked through to final destination with out incident.Pegasus is described as a low cost carrier and you get what you pay for ! and I am very happy with what I paid for !",9,"2016",5

I dont think i will fly with this airline any more.",9,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Geneva to Ankara via Istanbul SAW airport and return","Low cost airline from Turkey with hub at Istanbul's SAW airport. It has better service then Easyjet but the seats are not comfortable, not a lot of legroom. Not a lot of choice in terms of beverages and its better to order food on the plane.

SAW airport's eatery options are very good but noting interesting in terms of shopping. ESB airport in Ankara is good if you need to buy a last minute souvenir.

I have used the flight to Tehran too, Not much different, except ground staff rather cold in Tehran.",9,"2016",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Turkey to Manchester","It is impossible to pre-book your seats, luggage or any in-flight meals on their website or mobile app. This is a really low class airline, customer service is shocking. My flight didn't even exist on their own systems online, even though I had the booking a month in advance, and even on the day we departed, it still didn't exist.
They are very difficult to deal with online, on the telephone they are very disinterested in any issues you have.
The only plus is that due to their incompetence they forgot to charge me for my luggage on my return flight.
You have to pay for everything on the flight, not even water is free. There are no blankets on the plane at all, so at 11pm when these flights leave, and the plane is air-conditioned, it gets quite chilly...ok for me, but my daughter was quite uncomfortable.
i won't fly with this one again...ever!",9,"2016",1

We were ment to fly from Antalya to London Luton via Istanbul and Copenhagen . Firstly we were ment to fly to instanbul which was delayed by an hour meaning we missed our flight to Copenhagen. We had to stay at a hotel and catch a flight to Gatwick the next day. An absolute hassle with 2 children. No surprise that our flight to Gatwick was also delayed. We were assured that our baggage would be transferred to our Gatwick flight however when we get to the airport. None of our suitcases are there. We issued a report and they still haven't found our suitcases. Over £1000 of electronic devices and gifts were in our bags. Absolutely Horrendous.",9,"2016",1

The check in process at Gatwick was ok, The flight out was delayed by almost 1.5 hours, and when in Turkey boarding for the Dubai flight boarding was delayed by 1 hour as the staff at the boarding gate were note ready. All the way through there seemed to be a lack of organisation within this airline. The inside of the planes were not clean and smelt nasty. The flight back to Gatwick the air vents were not working and it was a very stuffy flight. Considering each leg was 4.5 hours long i would have expected some kind of entertainment, but there was none. The food on there was not great and of poor quality, and the online check in does not which meant I had to sit apart from my family unless I paid in advance.",8,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Customer service unacceptable during delay","When I need to summarize our experience, the main thing which stands really out with this airline is that not a single person of the entire Pegasus staff was indeed willing to help. They didn't even try. So while Pegaus might be cheap deal when everything goes as expected, you are basically lost if there you experience delays.

The story goes like this: we travelled from DUS to FRU via SAW. In Dues we were delayed, thus missed our connection flight and had to stay in SAW for a day. Sure, that's bad, bad this can happen. However, during the flight from DUS to SAW, but especially in SAW, the Pegasus staff was not even trying to actually help us. Few examples (they all would simply take to much time to write down): on the flight from DUS to SAW, we asked the stewardess if we will get our connection flight. They said they don't know and cannot ask or contact SAW. Another example: arriving in SAW we paced to the transit counter, asking if the flight to FRU is still there - the first reaction of the booth member was to laugh at us (!) and tell use ""it's gone"". She laughed again and then turned to another guest. We were not offered help or anything! Another example: searching for help in SAW we actually found someone who told us he would help us. He mentioned that we would get a hotel and told us to wait for him. We did. For more than 15 minutes. He just went away and never came back. Another example: back in Germany we tried to get compensation for the long delay. Since the web form makes has problems accepting PDFs files we called customer support. They were unwilling to tell us what to do: ""Please use the form"" - ""We try, but it tells us that the upload is not possible."" - ""Please use the form.""

I can truly say: having traveled across the world, with more then a dozen of airlines and many flights, I have never ever experienced anything like this before. Not even close.",8,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Decent airline","Good airline, good service, not much leg space or comfortable seats at all.
Plane was new and clean, pilots are professional. Departure and arrival on schedule. which is important for low cost - no expectations so no complaints from a low cost company",8,"2016",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","The first and last time I will use Pegasus","My husband and I wanted to travel to Antalya for our honeymoon and decided to try out Pegasus. On our way there everything was fine, we chose the basic package because the flights were short. On our way back was terrible. The gate was changed on our first flight from Antalya to Istanbul and no one informed us or the other passengers. I saw that our gate other passengers were boarding for another flight. No communication at all. Then I saw they moved our gate to the other side down 2 floors. Then we landed in Istanbul, our gate there was as well changed and again no one informed us. We saw it ourselves on the TV's. Then we all ran down again 2 floors to find our new gate. They also delayed it by 35 min even though it says only 20 min. No one ever explained to us why or even informed of gates changing or delays. I will never use this airline, I'd rather pay more and use Turkish Airlines. Also their en entire staff's English was horrendous!",8,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","The Devil's Airline","Worst Airline I have encountered in 53 years of traveling. Delays seem to be ""normal"" practice, for this Airline. Late Departures/Arrivals, general lack of professionalism & confusion, all around. Customer Care is Zero and Communication with passengers are non-existant. The initial impression at the counter is extremely off-putting, to say the least. The personnel seem to derive an uncanny pleasure from torturing and unsettling passengers.Threats, Admonitions and scare tactics are routinely, part of the Pegasus Corporate Culture.
Weight limit (20 Kg/8Kg), assessment, which are heavily enforced with An almost sadist bend, exceeds the measures from the Time of Spanish Inquisition.
Surviving the Check-in (read obstacle), you are faced with long delays (for 1 hour Flight), both at the gate(an hour) and in the plane(an hour) itself, no water is ever offered in the August heat & Humidity. To add insult to injury, beverages, including water are only offered for SALE on the plane (very Small Water :1.5 Euros/ thin canSodas 3 Euros).
Personnel can only be described as Apathetic, Indifferent, Tired and extremely Impatient and Dismissive.
BUYER BEWARE:
Please look at other Airlines, servicing the same destinations, for the same price, with much better service, possessing humanity and decency.",8,"2016",1

"Pegasus-Airlines","Must be worst airline ever!","Worst experience flying in a while.
The first flight was 2 hrs delayed which can happen. But my connecting flight did not wait and closed the boarding gate 10 mins before take off with no personnel around to help.
I asked on my plane where to get transfers and they sent me to international even though landed in Istanbul and flying nationally to Dalamaan. Then wouldn't tell other plane to wait for me or that I was coming. No body around to help and felt lost.
Random nice Turkish guy helped me as saw I was lost or otherwise would have been there for hours.
Went to Pegasus Airlines who said ok next flight in 5 hours, no apology, no anything!
Complained to company to no avail.
Considering this was caused by THEIR fault with delaying my first flight I would have expected something, but no nothing.
AWFUL AIRLINE, AWFUL SERVICE ALL ROUND, AVOID AT ALL COSTS",8,"2016",1

"Pegasus-Airlines","excellent airline","For a budget airline these guys do it with style! Pegasus airlines without a shadow of a doubt could put a lot of the major flag carriers to shame.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Terrible Dervice. Should never fly","This airlines is the worst in the world. Nobody should ever fly this airlines. We were delayed by 8 hours and we were forced to fly through Istanbul even when the airport was bombed the same week. They refused to reimburse our money and forced us to fly through Istanbul. On top of that we were kept waiting at the airport for 8 hours since the flights were delayed. All they provided was 4 euros for coffee, Terrible airlines and Yerrible sevice. Never fly these airlines!",8,"2016",1

"Pegasus-Airlines","Nice trip","We were using Pegasus airlines for our trip to North Cyprus. 19.07 - Sarajevo to Ercan via Istanbul (Sabiha airport) - the flight from London Stansted airport which we had been waiting at Sabiha airport for part of our trip from Istanbul to Ercan was delayed 90 minutes. That fact and delaying of our takeoff made our ""Sabiha stay"" even longer. The planes were very good and relatively new Boeing 737-800.
Return flights (31.07) had no delays.
All in all, we had good flights.",8,"2016",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Rip off","If you want to get messed about book with Pegasus. Our cases were 1.1kg over weight so we had to pay for this. No one could speak English and I was directed to a kiosk at the other end of the airport. I waited in the queue for 20 minutes only to be told I had to pay at the desk in had just been sent away from and it had to be in Turkish money which I didn't have much as I was only passing through. All in all they are very rude and unprofessional considering they class themselves as an international airport.",8,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","NOT BAD FOR AN ECONOMIC FLIGHT","Although it was my first flight , but was surprised with a departure delay of one hour(3:35 instead of 2:50 AM),the plane seats were rather old and rundown . The ground staff were helpful .The plane staff English was rather weak. I was lucky I had two seats empty to my side which enabled me to take a nap. Like all economic airlines they don't serve you a complementary meal.",8,"2016",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Average","Pegasus Airlines started their journey with a promising start; easy to book, good service and value for money. Unfortunately, as they get bigger they change their tactics; they provide easy jet service with Turkish Airlines prices. As they are the only airline direct flights to Izmir all year around, it is convenience and saving time instead of using two stop flights.
They are extremely expensive considering their services, always delays regardless of weather conditions. In summary, they either need to review their current service/rate strategy and amended accordingly or they will be in trouble in long term.",8,"2016",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Always a value for money flight deals, but always delayed","Pegasus is always my first choice when it comes to cheap and frequent flights to Turkey. It has nice comfy aircrafts but :
there is no free drink service.
They also have categories of ticket prices depends on the luggage you will carry. It used to give you free a 20kg luggage but now they cut it unfortunately because it was a great motivation to choose the airline instead of Greek more quality airlines like Aegean (with free service of beverages).
They always have delays in their flights sometimes up to 1,5 hour.

Still, the prices are very competitive and i recommend to always check the airlines offers.",8,"2016",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","If there was an option to click 0, I would","3rd time flying with Pegasus to Sharm el Sheikh via Istanbul, and they are always late. This time it resulted in a missed connection, a stay overnight at an Istanbul airport hotel, a 2 hour taxi ride over the Bosporous to Ataturk airport and replacement Egypt Air flights via Cairo to Sharm... a 30 hour trip all in all 😡 They said the connecting plane had already gone, so I was amazed when I was told my dive gear had made it there... didn't realise they could do mid-air baggage transfers! And I was even more amazed when the transit desk manager said ""We're busy... it's not my problem"". Quick call to the embassy changed their attitudes pretty sharpish though hence no money changing hands. Safe to say I'll never fly via Istanbul or with Pegasus again. See the photo for their definition of 'busy'. The things I do for #scuba ! If you're going to Sharm (where the diving is as beautiful as ever) before direct flights resume from the UK, strongly suggest you avoid Pegasus and go via Cairo with Egyptair or Milan with Meridiana. #livelovedive",8,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Chaotic","Getting to the Pegasus flight from SAW airport was stressing - stuck in traffic jams. The airport itself was over-crowded. There were fights between passengers and check-in staff - mostly over the weight of baggage. Only 15kg per passenger was allowed. Boarding was on time but plane took off an hour late. Just before take-off and landing passengers were standing over their seats or opening the luggage bin - and the crew said nothing to them. A little girl in the seat in front of me terrorised me for the duration of the entire flight by scaring me with her doll and making faces at me - unchecked by her parents.",8,"2016",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Cheap Air LIne in fact Looters","You will have to pay for each and every service like baggage, seats, food etc..
Do not expect even half refund if you cancel tickets. They do not post refund policy on websites and no one picks the call to clarify your queries.
I lost more than 70% on cancellation of tickets. So Avoid Pegasus and as well as Turkey (you must be knowing, why to avoid Turkey)...",8,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","One of the best low cost companies","Pegasus Airlines, based in Istanbul-Turkey, offers a good example of low cost airlines. Paying what you need, mostly on-time operations, experienced captains and friendly crew, all in all it's a nice airline if your aim is travelling between two points safe, fast and cheap.
I recommend it.",8,"2016",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Non Refundable","I booked 6 tickets before 3 month for QR 1700 each. When I want to do some changes, the agency asked for QR 580 for both ways and QR 295 for one way for each ticket. Of course non refundable means no meals on board. I noticed also that no TV screen in front of chairs or in the airplane at all. No port for wi fi. No blanket. You have to buy everything and it is very costly. Light breakfast is Euro 14 I guess or so. Airplane time was perfect. Crew were very nice and polite, but we don't see them because they relax with no service. The day I travel, ticket dropped from QR 1700 till QR 800 and few days before that it was QR 1300.
So, it is not a budget flight for me.",8,"2016",3

It took 3 days to get it back but was delivered to my hotel.",8,"2016",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","All round excellent service, good value for money.","This was a great flight as it was direct from Izmir to London Stansted, as it is normally quite difficult to get back to the UK from Turkey at this time of year other than flying via Istanbul. Prices are very good and the service was also good. I have found most Turkish airlines treat customers better than the UK airlines.",8,"2016",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Turkish Easy Jet!","It is what it is... Budget airline flight...wasn't helped by putting me & my 9 year old in an emergency exit row & then saying my daughter was too young to sit in that row. No legroom seats at all elsewhere & I'm six foot four. Uncomfortable, zero legroom, really untidy & messy pockets in front of you too, and sadly the hostesses really looked like they could not care less.",8,"2016",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Not renowned for helpfulness","Staff not particularly helpful, mostly Turkish on flights we have used. On one we didn't realise till very last moment had to alight as everyone sat on landing at Bodrum. Suddenly one member of staff realised we weren't going on to another airport! Not made clear at time of booking neither at check-in. We were very unimpressed at airlines dismissive and rude attitude towards us.",8,"2016",4

Also while you wait you will charge al half cent / 1.5 TL and the person I reach hang up the phone without any explanation.

Also Airport is closed, and flight is just canceled and they won't pay me back my ticket fee. I got engage via all over the online channels and they won't answer or just to keep social platform calm just let me inform about we are still working.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Back to UK.","Check in very efficient and friendly and quick. Cabin crew very friendly and helpful, they all seemed very efficient and certainly knew what they were doing. Seats roomy and comfy, general ambience was good. Both outward and return flights were on time.

"Pegasus-Airlines","Should Have Gone to Heathrow!","I must blame travel company, A Secret Turkey, for misleading information. We were not told that the airport we would fly into would be 90 minutes from the hotel unlike a few minutes for the other airport. The timing of the return flight (from Netanya connecting through Ataturk in Istanbul) was totally inconvenient (arriving at 1:00 am) and the wait on the last day was interminable. Also not advised that food service was available, but only if purchased ahead of time. I ordered meals for my friend and me for the return flight from Istanbul. They tried to serve me mine on the very short flight from Netanya. Of course, there was no meal on the flight to London for me and I have never even received a reply to my complaint.",8,"2016",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","It should be your last choice","It is right to say that it is among the cheapest flights, however, the class of service, staffing, timing, in flight service are all bad. Even the plane landing was annoying.",8,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Astonishingly yet reliably delayed","Due to recent events in Turkey I actually made a proper effort to get to the airport a good hour before take-off just in case security was heaving. Silly me. By the time I got through to departures, we already had a 30 min delay. Still, I thought, get to the gate in good time.... Delayed departure time came and passed. No plane, no explanation. There it is! Another 15 mins delay announced but no boarding yet. Eventually we took off 1 hr & 15 mins later than scheduled and landed a good 1.5 hours late. How Pegasus manage to consistently fail to take off on time (I fly this route regularly) and claim that they have an excellent record for NOT being delayed is completely beyond me. Sadly there are few choices and we are forced to live with this BS.",8,"2016",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","To avoid when possible","Flight departure with more than 1:30hrs of delay, only short notice from the flight deck about heavy traffic at SAW. Crew far from polite, not even knowing their own specials on the food & beverage list. Crew chatting in front behind a dirty curtain, so not letting guests go to front toilet but referring to toilet in craft's tail... Absurd. I only took this flight because compant paid for it. Seat 1C, so can't complain about legroom.",8,"2016",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst airlines I've used and I fly a lot!!","Arrived at gatwick 2 hours before flight was leaving, finally took off 4 hours later!!! Due to company being short staffed on the check in desks, computer glitches and missing 2 take off slots!!! The inside of the plane was grubby looking and dirty, food and drinks very expensive ( no choice as no time to purchase anything) flight was ok though ... Landed in Istanbul with a 1 1/2 hour wait for my connecting flight ... Informed flight was 30 minutes late! Boarded the plane to find the seat allocated was double booked, not just mine other passengers too, finally managed to be allocated a seat and arrived at my final destination only 30 minutes late (which was not an issue ) ... The organisation was awful, the staff were struggling to cope with the complaints ... Air crew blocked the aisles when serving refreshments when they saw someone waiting to get past ( a man waited for 15 minutes with no apology) I just found the whole experience appalling ... I have flown with 5 different airlines in the past year (even cheap and cheerful ones) and this is by far the worst company .. One thing though is the flights were smooth and I slept a lot and the pilots got me to my final destination safely",8,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Cheap flight","The flight was not delayed much. The stuff is attantive as usual. Pegasus is the airline to fly if you live on the anatolian side. Their loyalty program is also a very good one. If you want more legroom try to but the front or the exit seats",8,"2016",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","affordable price","The flight was good... I have no complaints..... I love flying with this company...they are cheap and safe, which is most important. We have no meal, but this was our option we chose.",8,"2016",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","No frills but great prices and always on time.","As we have property in Kusadasi and live in Braintree (20 mins from Stansted), Pegasus are an absolute godsend to us, as we can fly direct to Izmir Airport, which is about 45 mins from Kusadasi - this makes a door to door trip about 8 hours, including the mandatory 2 hour pre-flight booking in time, which suits us just fine!!

The prices are amazing reasonable, especially if you book well in advance, and the prices include 20kgs of luggage, so no nasty shocks when you finally get to seeing the final price, unlike a lot of other airlines.

We have used Pegasus in excess of 20 times in the last three years and, apart from one minor delay, all flights have taken off and landed on time or quite often, ahead of schedule.

The in-flight food menu is really good - you can either choose when making your booking or on flight. The cabin crew are obviously Turkish, but most have good English, and we have found them all to be very courteous, friendly and helpful.

Legroom is good - I am 6'2"" and always have ample legroom, but you can book extra legroom seats if required.

There are several daily flights right throughout the year - some go through Istanbul, then on to Izmir (and Northern Cyprus), but there are direct flights to Izmir, so double check if it's a direct flight you want.

All in all Pegasus offer very reasonable prices with a really good on flight service and excellent reliability which, at the end of the day, is all most of us want.",8,"2016",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Bad excuse of an airline and AIRPORT!!","BAD. BAD. BAD. Always delayed. No excuses. No security. Bad service. I know it is a low budget carrier but that doesn't give anyone the right to take one for granted. Also, that airport!! Wifi is NOT for free, you need to pay for every 30 mins. And be careful not all stores\restaurants are in on the wifi connection. Don't use it unless you have to. I'd prefer to pay a little extra and use another airline.",8,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","They got me there - almost on time","This is a low cost airline and you feel that. Legroom is more or less non existent, the flight attendants speak poor english and the drinks and food are overpriced. But they get the job done.",8,"2016",3

"Pegasus-Airlines","A punctual budget airline","I regularly use this service on a Monday morning to get to my latest assignment, and also to return on a Friday afternoon. This is a route served by several budget airlines, but this one is particularly good as it is always on time and after early, The staff are polite and friendly, with the exception of one senior cabin crew leader who felt it unnecessary to put on the seatbelt for take off and landing or to wear his tie throughout the whole of the flight. Without him the mark would have bee five instead of four. I particularly like the option to choose one's seat, to book extra legroom in advance and the option of pre-ordering food.",8,"2016",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","trip to Northern Cyprus","First time with Pegasus , on time ,friendly, smooth flight, could not find any faults on this budget airline. We had a good breakfast at Stansted before boarding so did not need to eat. All in all a good flight. Same on the way back on time. Would use them again",8,"2016",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Sorry, but this terrible","The past months I flew a couple of times with Pegasus and this was not what I expected from an airline company. Every time too late, way too late - one time I missed my train and had to buy very expensive new 1st class tickets - so the cheap flight became very expensive... never again! And no service at all and be carefull, everything has to be payed extra which makes it not a cheap company! An extra: since there is no food, some people bring their own food - horrible to sit next to persons eating even before departing. And everybody - although there are strict luggage rules - brings extra things on board which were not checked at the desk!",8,"2016",1

"Pegasus-Airlines","No complaints for the price","Pegasus is not a luxury airline, and it is often a drag flying at night and waiting around the airport in Istanbul, but this is their offer, and at a good price and schedule. What they offer, they supply. I have never had any problem with them, and I have flown them on a number of occasions from Europe to Israel, and will continue to do so. (The name, by the way, may be romantic for those who do not know Greek mythology, but consider what the mythological Pegasus did with his only passenger :-).)",8,"2016",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","A sweet little aircraft","Pegasus Airlines is a sweet little and busy aircraft that takes travelers all over Europe. I've flown with them for the last 3 years with no problems whatsoever. Staff is excellent and helpful and prices are very good. You can choose to buy meals and extras ahead of time or opt out.

Also on another flight they broke my Rucksack and after I filled in all the online forms and sent photos requested they said they Don't pay for broken !uggage !!!!!!",8,"2016",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Early break","Flight on time , crew very helpful, good choice of food onboard, reasonable selection of duty free at good prices.",8,"2016",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Screaming baby!","Screaming baby with parents who could not control or comfort her, made trip home hell from moment picked up from hotel until baggage reclaim at stansted. Ear splitting noise, not even drowned out by ear phones! Staff did not speak to them or ask them to move and no apology to other passengers. Invest in family only areas and allow other passengers to get some rest and sleep, which is difficult anyway as the seats are uncomfortable and very tight leg room.",8,"2016",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Mid prices and mid service","When we entered the airport we met other persons that should fly to turkey. They warned us that if we should fly this airline, dont expect to be on time.
Everything went well all the way, the landing in Istanbul was on time, and the leaving to Gazipaza was on time. we started to believe in the airline! But the we should land at Gazipaza. They said that it was to heavy winds, and after circling in the air for a long time, they headed off and landed in Antalya! It was then funny to hear that other airlines had been landing on Gazipaza before and just after pegasus!",8,"2016",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Ok for the price","Have flown with them before and it was very cramped and hot. Decided to pay for extra leg room for this flight and it was worth the money. Otherwise another no thrills airline.",8,"2016",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Dissatisfaction","it is a cheap flight provider, but the prices are actually not soo attractive in comparison to the service what you get. It was an old plane, very small leg space (I am 1.77), not competent crew. Next time I will most probably not use this company.",8,"2016",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","We were suprised","The staff was very helpful , the flight went on time . On ground and on the air everything was okay .we were very satisfied .",8,"2016",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Ok experince for low price","Flight was ok... For $300 round trip (through Istanbul) , including baggage - it was reasonable. One of the legs experienced an hour delay. Check-in was ok, although took longer than usual (long lines). the boarding was rather hectic.
But the rest was ok, I checked in online 3 days before, and got reasonable seats assigned. But no bag drop off line...",8,"2016",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Poor","Poor experience, I only book with Pegasus when there are no other choices. Seats are terribly uncomfortable, very little legroom, everything is dirty. Avoid it whenever possible.",8,"2016",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Flight to Northern Cyprus","Flight is a bit like a hop on hop off bus you get what you pay for at least you get to your destination. Food and drinks are extra, no tv. Plane comfortable though.",8,"2016",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","A Definitely Worthy Carrier","Even though legroom was not ideal for tall people, the flight was pleasant. In addition they are very organized with connecting flights at Sabiha Gokcen airport.",8,"2016",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Cheap flight nothing for free.","Flight was in-time. Plain was good. No music, no video, no free drinks, even water had to be paid. We paid almost €400,- .",8,"2016",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Affordable price","I have flied with Pegasus Airliness more than 20 times to many countries in Europe to Israel, Kazakhstan and Russia. Generally its cheap and good service and I have their credir card which gives me points to fly. But I had some experiences when I had to wait in Airports and have delays. I am always expecting delays when I fly with them.",8,"2016",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","domestic flights are definitely to avoid","Pegasus is right after Ryaniar, the most terrible airline company I ever flew with. I never had one single flight on time. They never give correct information to the passengers about exact time of the delayed departure. They keep people waiting. For me Pegasus means frustration.",8,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","low cost with different possibility fot select tbe service that fit for you.","no priority in boarding, but I suggest to take the ticket class that fit with your need, otherwise you can have wrong impression.",8,"2016",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","A good budget airlines","It is may not Qatar airways or united airline's but still it is worth for what you are paying for .I traveled from Berlin to Bahrain.the over all experience was good . I will definitely choose again. As it is good budget airlines",8,"2016",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","A Great Low cost Trip","Flight was pleasant compared to a low cost Airline and everything was good.
Airline is famous in its delays so you got to expect that in your plans
Hosts were very welcoming and helpful.
Recommended flight for sure.",8,"2016",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","A good name with no substance","Pegasus has become one of the main airlines in Turkey but they have some strange attitude. Their website uses cookies to increase price if you don't buy the first time and try alternative flight options. I had my luggage 2 times ripped in the past. In this particular flight, my luggage lock ( a small padlock) was gone, and top part was ripped. The strange thing is that lock was cut out with no damage to the place I put it!!! I reported on arrival, details taken but nobody rang back or sent an email. A very strong good quality luggage has been destroyed. No food, and very little allocated luggage weight. They also made me weigh my laptop bag half way through the journey (in Istanbul change) which was too bad. Avoid if you can.",8,"2016",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","You get what you pay for","Pegasus usually beat other carriers on price. But not always. The benefit flying from Istanbul to the Uk is the flight to Stansted, much quieter than Heathrow. The inflight staff are always polite and helpful. The inflight food is not overly expensive, and certainly value compared to airside food at Istanbul, although food options in the uk make buying food before boarding a better deal.",8,"2016",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Surprise that it was very good for an inexpensive airline","We booked this airline last minute since Alitalia was having some problems with strikes and cancelled our flight for the day. We traveled with 2 pieces of luggage (one each) and the trip was excellent and we were treated very well at checkin and during the flight.",8,"2016",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Good short flight","Just a quick hop ( 65 minutes) from Istanbul's second airport to Ercan Northern Cyprus. We enjoyed this busy flight, although there is no inflight magazine, let alone in flight entertainment, which seemed a surprise to many travellers. Our food was actually rather good, and considering the price of the flight and food was a good deal.",8,"2016",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","A necessary evil to get to Northern Cyprus","Going on holiday to Northern Cyprus, we decided to fly there (with the mandatory stop at Istanbul) rather than fly to the South and transfer across the ""green line"". The flight itself was fine, but the stop in Istanbul was a pain. At least we could remain on the plane, which evidently isn't always the case.

On this occasion there was two passengers who were supposed to disembark at Istanbul, but obviously hadn't realised we had arrived. The cabin staff walked up and down counting the number of passengers several times before we all had to get our passports and boarding cards out. The two idiots were eventually found and, as you can imagine, were really popular with everyone as it caused a further delay by missing our take-off slot.

Not the airline's fault, but I'm sure this happens quite a lot. Next time I think I'll avoid taking a flight that goes through Istanbul.",8,"2016",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","on the day of coup...","on the 15th of july, from sabiha to izmir. pegasus is my preferred carrier... though, a low cost carrier, the service and the extras are superb. you pay only 6 lira for the best filter coffee.",8,"2016",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Not great and not cheap in summer","The tickets price was expensive and not far off the cost of a seat with Turkish airlines. The pre flight service was not great, on board similar. Similar service to Ryan air but not low cost. If I had the choice would much rather travel with Turkish airlines to North Cyprus",8,"2016",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Ok'ish","This airline is good but their soaring cost with NO food, NO glass of water and hardly any courtesy.

For this low level airline I won't be paying this sort of money to them as for the SAME amount I can travel with Turkish Airlines and get FOOD served, a small snack given (normally biscuits, nuts or dried fruit etc.), EXTRA leg space and Perfect level of service and courtesy at all times.

Sorry guys, but you need to sort out your prices and the rest first of all.",8,"2016",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","very much ""OK"", but no frills","Did the job; small delays at each stage; the silly stopover in Istanbul (not the airlines fault).
A very flakey website - some had checked in online, some had reserved seats, some booked meals - others had not been able to. Telephone helpline was 24hours but took no real action.",8,"2016",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Never again","I travelled to dalaman from London Gatwick in may with pegasus airline . There was 4 sectors . LGW- saw , Saw- Dalaman n same back and every sector flight was delayed and coz of that i missed my connecting flights and on my way back i missed my coach back home n had to wait hours at the airport . Ahhhhh terrible experience . Never again .",8,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Low cost airelines","Pegasus Airlines should be low cost ..but, their ticket prices doesn't matches with services they provide! For similar or same price other Company offers drink and meal...in Pgs. you have to pay extra even for water !! With them fly only on short distance and avoid long distance flights ! ... addition information, do not be surprised if flight delayed !",8,"2016",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","An ok ailine. Amazing web page and low cost deals","Good Airline. Amazing prices. Excellent web site. They offer transportation and you get just that. I mean, just that.",8,"2016",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Functional!","I have travelled with Pegasus many times. Generally, they get the job done with few frills. The plan stops in Istanbul where passengers disembark. This travelling onto Ercan stay on the plane. After refuelling and picking up more passengers, the plane travels onwards. The wait is generally 45 mins to an hour.
All in all, hardly a thrilling or luxury experience, more practical and functional!",8,"2016",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","With Pegasus to Istanbul","For low cost flight this option is ok.What I dont like is flight in 3.15 morning, so night without sleep. But from my city no much choices.You are lucky if flight no full and you can take 3 sits togather and sleep little bit.
On back way often delay , guess because other peoples in connection via Istanbul and their flights delayed.This hard if long delay as happend few times to me.
This option may good for adults who want direct flight with saving time and money and dont mind about comfort.But hard if you travel with kids.
In winter time shedule more pleasunt regarding some days flights operate in day time",8,"2016",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Terrible! Don't do it!!","My two sisters and I were heading to Amsterdam on Pegasus airlines connecting through Sabiha airport in Turkey. Online check in wasn't working for two of the three of us, the website replied with ""error"" for 12 hours before the flight. Upon arriving to the Dubai airport, we headed directly to the counter where two of us checked in with no problem (as we booked our flights on the same reservation). My sisters reservation could not be found even though she had confirmation and proof of payment. The agent, Maya, said she would wait for confirmation from the Head Office that the flight confirmation was valid as sometimes the system updates and they ""lose people"" who have paid for flights. She was nice to say that if the flight was about to board she would validate the ticket since we obviously had a confirmation, the same last names, and were all traveling together. They would only provide us the ticket from Dubai to Sabiha and said we would have to get the ticket from Sabiha to Amsterdam once we arrived in Sabiha (airline policy). We were dumbfounded but Maya just smiled and said ""welcome to Pegasus"" (should have known from that comment that things would only get worse but we were excited for our trip and hopeful). I'll skip past boarding the flight, the uncomfortable seats, and rude service from most of the airline attendants....that's to be expected with budget airlines and what you accept when you purchase the ticket. We arrive to Sabiha airport an hour late....no real reason why or explanation provided. This cut our 1 hour and 45 minute connection to 45 minutes. We head to the transfer counter to get our connection ticket...it's a mad dash with no requirements to stand on line or address anyone's ticket issues based on connection times. The employees didn't seem to care and just dealt with whoever jumped in their face next. We get to the counter and are told are reservations have been frozen and they cannot provide us with our tickets. They could not say why or what they were going to do to fix it. They kind of just stood around drinking water and texting on their phones. We stressed the urgency that our flight was now taking off in 30 minutes....then 20 minutes....nothing. They couldn't explain anything and just kept asking us if we paid for our flights. We were also told that our credit cards were frozen and that Turkey doesn't accept visa payments. My sister who was able to check in online went through security and got to the gate where she was told we just needed to show them the credit card as proof of payment. My sister ran back from the gate to the ticketing place and we explained what she was told but they didn't understand or believe us. They said they called the gate and told us we weren't telling the truth. At this point the flight was taking off....we were told to pay for a visa ($90 total) just to head to the ticketing office within the airport to see if they could fix our problem. One agent, Muhammad, said that if it was Pegasus's fault that we missed the flight they would reimburse us for the additional expenses incurred. We paid for the visas and went to the ticket counter. After a series of ""we can't help you"" we found someone named Yavuz who, once we explained the problem, fixed it in 60 seconds. He made excuses that the entire crew downstairs didn't understand the issue and then admitted that the airline screwed up and this situation should have been remedied at the counter and should not have caused us to miss our flight. He booked us on the next flight out (8 hours from our original flight) and referred us to the manager, Melike Gulner #2432, to offer us monetary or service compensation for losing a day of our trip. This is the point where I decided a review was to be written. She was so rude - she refused to hear the whole story because she kept cutting me off after every sentence and told us that booking us on the next flight out was Pegasus doing us a service. She also offered to pay us back for our remaining tickets and for us to figure out our remaining travel plans on our own. She insisted there was nothing she could do and would walk away or raise her voice as if that would put us off. This turned into a screaming match at the airport check in. She insisted that any other issues we have should be directed to Pegasus customer service via email and she walked away. Understanding that mistakes were made on Pegasus' part which caused us to miss our flight and spend a day at the airport, the fact that the employees did not care at all about any customers issues and no sense of customer service on a face to face basis was unacceptable. They were slow and unprofessional. They were sarcastic and laughing in customers faces. Speaking in Turkish and clearly saying inappropriate things if not cursing ..and really made you feel that because they worked for a budget airline, they couldn't be bothered to do their jobs. That being said, this 2.5 hour saga allowed us to hear other customers issues that were a lot worse than ours....where people paid and were confirmed on flights that didn't exist and flights arrived late with the only option of a future flight 2-3 days later (and they were refused refunds). It really made you feel bad for people who were dealing with the same rude good-for-nothing employees we had this experience with. Overall it was unfortunate that a bad situation turned terrible because of the lack of tact, remorse, and basic training in customer service was the principle issue in this situation. Needless to say I will never fly with Pegasus again and hope that anyone reading this will just be aware of what they're getting into when choosing this specific budget airline.",8,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Ok","Smooth flight. Great take offs and landings, but could do with a bit more room.
Staff all looked bored.",8,"2016",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","awesome","very friendly, very polite, comfortable, enjoyable.. nice seats .. we had extra legroom travelled with my family and my brother and his wife, excellent service throughout",8,"2016",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Not the best","The Aircraft was on the Tarmac and we were on the bus heading out however Air Traffic delay of and hour the number one had a face on her that would have stopped a bus - they were a bad tempered - miserable crew - I got my sandwich - eat it - and ordered a beer - best part of the flight - the airport at SAW was a mess spent 1.5 hours in Q waiting to get in - forget it will never do that again - these people need to wake up if they want tourists.",8,"2016",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Be ready to lose your luggage when you fly with Pegasus Airlines!","Me and my family have been flying back and forth between Turkey and UK, since I started to live in the UK 8 years ago. We preferred to fly with Pegasus Airlines as they fly to London Stansted Airport which is convenient for my home and Turkish Airlines don't fly to Stansted. However, in the last few years delayed luggage became a frequent problem with Pegasus. They lose and deliver our luggage 4-5 days late on 1 out of 3 flights we had with them in the last few years. Their customer service is non-existent as they reply to our inquiries with 1 week delay...We are fed up with this airline and will use other lines although we have to fly to Gatwick or Heathrow which are quite far from where I live...Better than getting angry and losing precious time with family waiting for the luggage.",7,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Pegasus Airline for Travel within Turkey","During September, 2015, I and my wife were on a group-tour to Turkey and Greece. For our visit to the Cappadocia region, we travelled from Istanbul to Kayseri and back by Pegasus Airlines - a Turkish low cost airline. We found the service quite good and had a comfortable journey. Pegasus Airline is a convenient way to travel within Turkey.",7,"2016",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Poor","This is the first time my husband and I flew Pegasus Airline. We flew from Cologne to Tehran via Istanbul and we think we will not fly them anymore ever again. The customer service was below average, the seats are tight and we are having problem with our inclusive meal in every sector of our flight.

We have bought the Advantage package, which includes 30 kg luggage, seat selection and Sandwich + Beverage. None of the flight sector accepted our claiming of food because they said it was not shown in their list and we should have book it in advance online. But there was no function or page online that allows us to choose our sandwich. The crew does not even know what is included in the Package, seems like their knowledge our company's products is limited.

I wrote an email to the customer service to solve this issue one week before our flight back to Cologne as there is no Pegasus office in Tehran. Unfortunately, they only reply my email today, which is 2 days after my return flight! The customer service just wrote a short 2 sentences email and told me that no food to be served on Tehran flight. But the whole case was not just Tehran, it was all the sectors! I have attached the booking page screen shot here, there was no where mentioning that we food was not included in Tehran flight which is what they are claiming, not even in our printed itinerary! The sandwich does not cost much of money and we are not petty about a sandwich, but the fact is we have paid for it and they should offer us the service that we have paid for!

Below are the summaries of our flight experience with Pegasus:

Cologne to Istanbul: Flight delayed due to the coup crisis in Istanbul (our bad luck!) but the ground staff handled the situation well. The crew on board were OK, the legroom is acceptable at this point. No food can be claimed according to crew as they don't have us in their list.

Istanbul to Tehran: Crews were rude and unfriendly. Narrow legroom and seats are tight. No food can be claimed again.

Tehran to Istanbul: Crews were OK. Narrow legroom and seats are tight. The representative from Tehran took our name and said she will settle the food problem for us, but when we were on board, no food can be claimed again.

Istanbul to Cologne: Crews were OK. Narrow legroom and seats are tight. No food can be claimed again. There was a little girl sitting behind us and has been kicking our seat from the back for like 4 hours and she wouldn't stop even we complained to the mother and the stewardess even talked to the mother. The mother didn't care at all! This is the worst flight sector ever. We had the same problem with little kids behind us when we flew Turkish Airlines from Istanbul back to Frankfurt last year.

I don't think this is the right was of operating an airline. Pegasus should consider changing their online system to be more user friendly and retrain their staff and crews about the products of the company.",7,"2016",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Terrible!","I don't know how Germany lets this airline into the country, they are terrible, no security at all, on board on the ground, staff totally lost! a total mess! would avoid it!",7,"2016",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","good service at an affordable price","I mostly use Pegasus Airlines for my domestic flight since they usually give you the best offer (but not always). I have experienced many delays but they were mostly due to the air traffic at the Sabiha Gokcen Airport (in İstanbul). Maximum I have experienced was 2 hours. They do not offer you any in-flight meal with your ticket. But you can buy from the in flight options. They offer sandwiches, grilled meatballs etc. I haven't tried them but a couple of my friends did and they said it was good. The prices are not that bad. But I would at least expect them to offer water for free.",7,"2016",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Flying with Pegasus to Turkey and Georgia","A good solid airline with good timings and pleasant polite staff and comfortable aircraft and clean facilities. Used them twice to fly to Istanbul,Turkey and then on a second flight to Batumi Airport Georgia and also from Istanbul to Trabzon Airport in Northern Turkey. No frills particularly but good prices for 2 people return to UK and reliable.",7,"2016",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Excellent quality and value domestic carrier in Turkey","Great service - plane looked new and was immaculately clean, plus the flight was extremely good value. We will definitely be using Pegasus again.",7,"2016",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","helpfull when i fill sick","i wasnt filling well before the flight
ive ask the air crew to notice me if ill need something
and they always check on me
its was great to know that they really try to make me fill good",7,"2016",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Good Budget Airline - easy transition via Istanbul","Pleasantly surprised for a budget flight - Well looked after , food include in price . Would use again!",7,"2016",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Sitting on Tarmac for one hour without air conditioning","Standing on Tarmac for one hour without air conditioning is legal but outright offensive to the passengers in 40 Celsius with the sole objective of saving fuel. I read about the topic extensively regarding The pilot choice of not turning on the air-conditioning and apparently there are no technical reasons why they would not do so. It seems to be a clear choice/internal policy of the airline. Apparently not illegal according to European commission directives which state that the air-conditioning has to work after one hour of sitting on the tarmac. The stewardesses were quite clueless as to how to handle my complaint. The rest of the aspects of the experience were positive however the heat issue was so extreme that an overall two star was well deserved.",7,"2016",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Avoid!","I had to fly with Pegasus as there were very few options to fly from Athens to Antalya and Pegasus offered a flight with decent connection times and flight times.

I had booked the advantage package, which included the seats and meals. However, at check-in the seat reservation was disregarded and I was given something totally unsuitable. After showing my booking with seat numbers (you would think they would come up automatically on their systems) they reluctantly changed it to something closer to the original option. Questions asked at the time such as 'Oh you don't want to sit there, why? Is it a problem?' Well, yes, it is a problem, they charge for something that they do not want to provide.

Then, there a was quite a long delay, which was not stated anywhere. All flight times were still showing up as normal. This lasted about two hours! With only one answer given by the representatives, you will board in 15 minutes. This reflected very negatively on the connection times and caused a lot of issues and stress. Information is crucial so that passengers can have a clear understanding of the situation. Not everyone has time to waste.

The pre-ordered food was totally dreadful and went in the bin. Shameful that they charge for something like this.",7,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worse than Ryan Air.","We know you get what you pay for but there's only so much people can put up with. Naturally there isn't much leg room which is understandable in these planes and there is the option to pay for additional leg room. However, I do not understand why they build these planes so people can put there seats back and practically lay in your lap. It is ridiculous! On our flight from Stansted, stop off in Istanbul then to North Cyprus we sat at the back and were uncomfortably hot! There was no air con and so we had to put up with a stuffy flight the whole way there. We stopped at Istanbul and were delayed by an hour and the staff on board were so rude! It just wasn't on! In addition to this, the landing was horrendous, nothing smooth about it. Coming back from North Cyprus the staff on board were even worse. The staff spoke to us as if were something they'd seen on their shoe. Again, I know it's a low cost airline but it doesn't mean they can speak to people with little respect. The food was the only good thing about it and that's only because it was packaged. Definitely wouldn't recommend!",7,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","All is forgiven - well nearly!","I had booked flights with Pegasus in December 2015 and was looking forward to my trip in June when they cancelled my flight with just 2 weeks to go. To say I was unhappy would be a massive understatement as I had organised all my transfers and needed to get things sorted out for my apartment over there.I contacted them more in anger and frustration than any real hope of a result, but must say that they handled the situation very well and offered a full refund as well as 400 euros compensation for my wife and myself. Credit where credit is due and I would now consider using them again in the future. Almost worth all the hassle (but not quite!)",7,"2016",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Very affordable and good service","I've flown this airline from Dubai to Istanbul and Istanbul to Rome. For a low cost airline, the price, it is fantastic. Can't beat it. Staff are friendly, helpful and accommodating. They lack in-flight service (they are low cost) and you pay for everything on board, except water. Flights are organized, seats are comfortable and their safety videos, among some of the best I've ever seen. From children narrating the safety video in the past, to superheroes on my last flight. Highly recommend it, they do a fantastic job!",7,"2016",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Horrific","The plane arrived as it was scheduled to take off, which we and the other passengers where in formed it would only take 5 minutes, 35 minutes later the gate opened, only to wait another 15 minutes. Once at our seats we find out a large garbage bag full of soup ,which was leaking onto the SEATS below, causing several of our party's seats to be soaking wet and covered in unidentifiable chunks. The cabin crew responded by giving us extra head covers to sit on.",7,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","It's not bad","Ι was expecting the worst after reading so many negative reviews. I fortunately didn't experience any delays, though the situation was pretty uncertain in Turkey because of the coup 2 days before my return flight. It's a low cost company so I wasn't expecting any special treatment. Seat and leg room was average. I was travelling with a friend and we were automatically given seats next to one another, so we didn't have to pay extra to change seats at on line check-in. Didn't order meals because all of my 4 flights were pretty short (more or less 1h 15 min).",7,"2016",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Comfortable trip but need to work on scheduling","Seats comfortable with more legroom than is usual in economy class. The flight crew were pleasant and helpful. What needs work is staying on schedule. We traveled on 4 flights and not one boarded at the time stated.",7,"2016",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Priceworthy","Already had a couple of flights with Pegasus (""flypgs"", always reminds me on ""flying pigs""). Priceworthy but you have to deal with:
- poor legroom
- no free drinks or snacks
- sometimes not even service
- sometimes enormous delays (maybe not their fault...)",7,"2016",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Could be better for what you pay","We flew as a family, we were 4 adults and two children, I bought the seats in order to be together, and as well food for the kids, that was very simple, but they charge it as a supreme menu, they can do it better, and offer a better service, later, they are very bad with luggage and they lost two child seats in the transfer, and never found them, nor paid for them",7,"2016",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Aircrew misarable","Never encountered staff so miserable and inattentive. The temperature of the flight was ridiculously hot (before they were selling cold drinks) and repeated attempts by many for cooler air failed. Long messages from cabin staff to passengers but English translation minimal. They didn't even stop passengers from accessing overhead lockers straight after landing as the plane made its way to the terminal building. Food prices expensive",7,"2016",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Allways late","We had to take 2 flights to go from Madrid (Spain) to Bodrum (Turkey) and missed the second flight because the first was 2 hours delayed. It was delayed without any explanation, because at this company it is usual to be delayed.",7,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Low cost airlines- redifined","Fabulous prices for anyone wanting to travel in Europe. Even though the in-flight service is absent its a good option for students, back packers etc.",7,"2016",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","the worst airline ever!!!!","Pegasus Airlines is the worst airline ever. Rude staff with no manners. delays, delays and still delays without notice. When you seat on the plane often you have to wait almost one hour before departure. SAW airport in Istanbul is not organized at all! I flew from BLQ to SAW and after SAW to EBL, all flights were on delay! AVOID PEGASUS AIRLINES!",7,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Good For Domestic Flights","We were flying from Istanbul Sabiha Gokcen Airport to Antalya. The flight was short. You had to pay for food, the food is allways paid in Pegasus Airlines. Plane was a little delayed but it was ok. The flight was not that bad because it was short.",7,"2016",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Needs more promotions!","I flew more than 5 times with Pegasus in the last month Domestic and International.
They should offer better sandwiches.
Our flight from Italy to Turkey had some delays.
It would be great if they could offer more promotions.",7,"2016",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","it is really good service","if they would like to improve their service quality, they should get discount on products. we wish to see it.",7,"2016",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","flight with no entertainment","my flight was not a comfort one and there was nothing to entertain. of course it was a short trip but nothing to remember and no attractive moment during the flight. but the price have something to say because it is really cheaper than other international flights. there is no free food or drink during the flight but you can pay in dollars and order something to eat or drink.",7,"2016",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Comfortable trip","Really enjoyed my first time experience on plane. The service is also good but it can be improved anyway.",7,"2016",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Rude flight attendants","You do get what you pay for on this airline, which is priced sufficiently below Turkish Airlines to warrant coping with the inconvenient hours and minimal seat space. However, I have never encountered a flight attendant who would snap her fingers at a customer to get their attention to close or open the window shade. This happened twice--once upon take-off and once upon landing. Granted that most of the passengers are Turkish, so the woman didn't want to bother herself to speak English when addressing a passenger who clearly didn't look Turkish. This passenger was my niece who was in deep sleep mode and didn't notice her. However, I do speak Turkish and heard her requests, and complied with them. The strange thing was when I took this attendant aside upon disembarking, and tried to tell her in a friendly manner that one may snap one's fingers when communicating with a dog, but such a behavior is inappropriate with a human being, at least in North American or European culture. Her response was, ""I'm sorry you misunderstood me."" No apologies; instead, it was my fault for misunderstanding her! They have a long way to go in learning decent customer service and civilized behavior.",7,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","By far the worst airline","Don't do the same mistake and book with this flying bus. I had the worst experience of my life. Our flight was delayed 4 hours and we missed the transit flight. The behavior of the staff was very bad. Nobody said a sorry. We were left in the terminal to wait another 7 hours. Sleepless. They gave us a macDonald's voucher as a gift. It's like a bad joke. Don't give money to these unprofessional people.",7,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Bad experience","I already pay for selected seat and on boarding they give me different seats and on doing discussion they said it is busy flight beside there was delayment more than 3 hours and they not told us except in airport",7,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Okay Discount Airline","Nothing special about this airline, but the price was right when I needed to book on very short notice. About what you'd expect from a discount airline, minimal legroom, not much service, but okay for a short flight.",7,"2016",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","First time on Pegasus","The journey between Doha and London (Standsted) was surprisingly a pleasant one. The flight left on time at 3.50am and arrived mid morning in Istanbul. The departing flight to London left on time and was just as pleasant and actually arrived slightly earlier than scheduled.

Slight confusion when disembarking at Istanbul. If you have been issued with a boarding card for the onward journey you don't need to queue up in the transit line, just go through security and get your connecting flight.

Would I travel on this budget airline again? Yes, I would. Would I recommend this flight for tall or overweight customers, no I wouldn't.",6,"2016",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Nope.","The flight attendants were so rude, a steward even yelled at a woman who didn't know where to go. Drinks & food very pricy.",6,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Used to be excellent","Used them several times always on time, now every flight we have taken has been late. Istanbul is not big enough to take all the flights so delays after delays, which has a knock on effect with transfer flights, so beware a 5+ hour flight usually takes over 7 hours which is not acceptable.",6,"2016",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Average,nothing special","This was my first airline I have ever used. I wasn't much satisfied with them.
The crew spoke mostly Turkish, rather than English. I think the English they spoke was of not much quality too. I was booked with a connecting flight.. I basically was traveling 24h, since I had a delay of 7h at the Sabina G. airport in Istanbul. You had to pay for your meal, or to buy something before boarding and bring it up with you. The customer service was really poor, the crew wasn't much interested. They were basically just doing their job straight forward.",6,"2016",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst experience I ever had","Worst experience I ever had!!!

1. The flight attendants and the ground stuff are not friendly, they treat the passengers badly
2. No Air condition in the flight,
3. The pilots are horrible (I had 2 flights with them), I almost throw up during the landing and I don't suffer from any flight sickness.
4. My suitcase was damaged.
5. The fight was delayed in hour
6. They don't offer any water in the flight, if you want water you need to pay for it
7. The toilets in the plane were disgusting, seems like they were never cleaned up before the flight.

I will never fly with Pegasus Airlines again!",6,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Good airlines","It was a good flight with these airlines. They gave us wet napkins and soft drinks, for other alcoholic drinks you should pay. Hope it still works like that.
Plane was not new, but was clean and cabin crew was very nice, smilling all the time.",6,"2016",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Cheap and good","Cheap price, good service, 5 hours connection in Istanbul, and 1:30 on the back. Check in process fast.",6,"2016",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Second name is delay","Pegasus has new aircrafts, nice staff but only the problem with this airlines is delay. So be prepared if you have a connection flight. Give extra time between two flight. I flight many time with Pegasus and always delayed , changed several time boarding gate.
Except this I didn't face any other problems.",6,"2016",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","ABSOLUTE JOKE","This company is a shambles. Me and my partner booked a DIRECT flight from Manchester to Dalaman as I do not fly well. We was supposed to leave at 9:20am to then not leave till 10am. Then we was told we will be landing at Gatwick to change staff and to allow passengers to get off and new to get on and also to refill the plane. We landed at Gatwick at 10:45am we then wasn't allowed out of our seats, any food, drinks, the toilet and there was no aircon until we took off at 12pm. Then finally at 1pm we were able to order our first drink/food. Which was served without a smile or any manners as no one spoke English.
Our flight ended up being a total of 7hours even though we got told it would take 4hr 30mins. This airline is a joke. I would never use or recommend this company to anyone.",6,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Long delays at checkin, hot stuffy plane, slow in flight service","i didnt deliberately book with Pegasus, i booked with Thompson who it appeared merged 2 or 3 of their own flights presumably as non of them were full and then farmed it out to this lot. Result, couldnt check in on line ...had hour queue on way out and more on way back because on way back they sent wrong passenger list to airport...so we were kept waiting for ages for the proper list to be sent. this took about 30 to 40mins. must have used carier pigeon not email. i did however get the aisle seats i requested. the inflight menus were priced in £ and € but not Turkish lira ....and this was a flight to Turkey so many people wanted to pay in Lira which cause major confusion and delay because they had to use a calculator for each transaction. You would have thought that having this expdrience on the outward flight, that someone at Pegusus would have provided cabin staff with a sales list in Turkish Lira for the return flight a week later... but no they hadnt and of course coming back even more passengers wanted to use up the Lira they had left. im glad i was sitting in one if thd first few rows as those at back must have been dying of thirst by the time they got to them. The aircraft was boiling hot both ways. It appeared they only put on the AC just as we started to make our desent ie the last 20min of 4 hour flight. The flight attendents hadnt seemed to be trained on how to cope with mums wanting to take kids to the loo at the front of the plane, while they were blocking the way with the refeshment trolley. Quite humorous exchanges wigh the mums trying to explain that young johnny would piss on the floor unless they would back down thd aisle and let them through. All i can say is it your travel company tells you thag its Pegasus Airlines they are going to use... cancel and rebook elsewear.",6,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Below avarage","The flight was very tiering altho it is short the seats are packed there is a control panel for radio and an output for headphones on the arm res which didn't work my tray tray table was broken i wasn't able to put it up the whole duration of the flight which is clearly against safety rules and the crew announcements. The pa system was terrible i couldn't understand a word",6,"2016",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","It could be better!","It was really a disappointment. I have to wait three hours of delay even the cost of the ticket was very expensive. I would avoid another trip like that.",5,"2016",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Cheap tickets but look for an alternative","If possible look for an alternative airline company. This review is about my experience with one particular flight only, but it is enough to put me off travelling with Pegasus in future. We arrived at the airport to check in for our return 1.15 pm flight, but were told that the flight had been cancelled. We couldn't check in online previous to travelling as their website was down. Apparently they had tried to contact us by phone, and although they had our email address, from which we received emails they did not use this. We were faced with a 12 hour delay, and offered no food, drink, accommodation etc. Staff who could have helped, did not, and were rude. Eventually, by sheer persistence we managed to find someone (not Pegasus staff) who took pity on us and reduced our delay to 7 hrs. On complaining to Pegasus through their website and Facebook, I have had no response so far, and I have been waiting 3 weeks! Do yourself a favour and look for an alternative way of travelling.",5,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Good, friendly service.","Only a short flight but very good and friendly service.
Undoubtedly, good value for money and would not hesitate to fly with them again.",5,"2016",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Pegasus is terrible","Pegasus airline was the first bargain airlines established about 10 years ago. Established by one if the super rich families in turkey it was run very well in the first couple of years. However now, everything about Pegasus is terrible. This is the last time I will be flying with them. Their delays are notorious , they are never on time. They charge for everything separately you just can't believe ?!? Don't fly with them.",5,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Ridiculous weight restrictions","I flew on three Pegasus flights within 7 days. All were awful. The worst thing is the ridiculous limited weight for both checked and carry-on baggage. Carry-on is limited to 8 KG (my small suitcase empty is 6 KG). I weighed, transferred things to checked baggage, and re-weighed several times to meet the restriction. Then when checking in, even though my carry-on bag only weighed 7.2 KG (which was perfectly visible on the scale), the Pegasus agent kept insisting that my bag was 2 KG overweight. When I asked how much the extra weight (which she couldn't understand was actually below 8 KG), she shrugged her shoulders. It was complete incompetence. Finally her supervisor explained that the weight was fine.
Fortunately, a fellow passenger told me that a passenger could carry on a second bag that wasn't even weighed! So, naturally, I put my heaviest items in my extra bag - only to return the heavy items to my carry-on bag right after it had been weighed. The whole thing felt like harassment and was totally absurd! I went through this hassle on each of the three flights.
Finally, nothing on board is without cost. Not even a drink of water is provided.
I'll never fly Pegasus again, and I don't recommend that anyone do so.",5,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Fly Pgs","On an economy flight I dont expect luxury. I would hope for polite and helpful staff and a company which does what it says on the tin. In other words gets you to the airport on the day and time it says it will.
This is the second time I have flown with this company and the flight was late leaving ..so misssed the connection,,,so passsengers were stresses ...so were transported to a hotel. Other than the flight crew I found the employess rude and unhelpful. I was offerd 26 pounds to re-schedule another flight. They said the company was offering accomodation in a hotel and if I didnt like it to stay in the airport!
Whilst I was waitng at the transfer desk for the bus another 50 people turned up also late for the Doha flight - I guess since there was not another flight to Doha that night that the plane which eft was almost empty and that we all stayed the night in the hotel. I am curious to know why an airline would hae a deal with a hotel which takes such numbers of people who have missed a flight? what is going on here? Is the immigration in on the deal beacause tourists have to buy a visa before they go to a hotel? is the tourist industry making money because when guests stay in the hotel they spend money using up late rooms that otherwise wouldnt have been booked or drinks from overnighters who wouldnt have come? Can someone enlighten me on the lack of effort to get visitors on the next available flight? Someone is making a good business out of Pegasus flight passengers at the cost of them arriving on time on a scheduled flight",5,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Price was very reasonable, and waiting times SHORT","We flew to Istanbul for a few days and were very pleased at how fast and efficient the airline was, especially since it was a lower price than other airlines. The planes land on the Asian side, but we found that if you calculate the traffic hours and avoid them, you can really save time overall.
I ordered an airplane meal along with the ticket and it was really not sufficient, but other than that minor detail, we were very happy.",5,"2016",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Good Flight","The Flight was good. The service was very courteous and good. The food was nice. The take off and landing was quite smooth. On the negative side, the flight was not on time, due to several flights still on the runway ahead of my flight (not yet taken off).",5,"2016",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","flightattendants was so nice","The flight attendants at Pegasus was awesome, and i have never met as nice flightattendants before. Happy, smiling and giving great service.",5,"2016",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worse airline ever! AVOID! AVOID! AVOID!","We had a transit to Istanbul for 3h which was quite short considering that we were over an hour late from Marseille to Istanbul. We thought it happens; another 1.5h late from Istanbul to Dubai. No appology, no communication nothing.
On the way back the same again; from Dubai to Istanbul, we had to take a bus to reach the plane which is always short; they kept us like animals standing there, it was so crowded for 45 minutes and there was no explanations....they refused to open the door; we felt so claustrophobic; it was ridiculous!!!! When they finally opened the door; the driver told us don't start arguing with me; you need to speak with the pilot of the plane; when we got on the plane the staff didn't even bother to apologies; all they said, they also had to wait like us and they argued back with the passenger, there was no apologies; I couldn't believe it!!!!!!!!!!!
The plane are very uncomfortable; we even paid extra for xxl seats to have more comfort and space £140 extra for two); they allocated us regular seats by mistake. The nightmare wasn't over; from Istanbul to Marseille there was over an hour late AGAIN.
This was the worse flight we ever took and we will never ever travel again with PEGASUS. i would strongly advise you NOT to use them. Our faults as when we read the reviews on trip advisor there were so negative but I still wanted to give it a go. NEVER AGAIN. TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.",5,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","It was ok","I can't really complain since my trip to Dubai from zurich was super cheap. You dont get a meal, which is ok for the fare. But you have Option to order Food and pay. The legroom isnt that big, you sit quite tight. One Thing they could Change is that the staff should learn better english or on how to speak with customers. It gives you a rude Impression on how they approach People in the plane. I wasnt quite sure if it was just because of the english language, that the staff isnt that well trained.",5,"2016",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","So-so","Low cost companies, tickets are very cheap (extra for meals, extra for choosing seat..). Stewardess are quite friendly.
Don't wait to be inform when your flight change, no email..
We must buy new ticket to don't loose our connection, still with Pegasus, we NEVER found somebody who speak English to refund us, and also on the phone (and trust me I try..) Pity !",5,"2016",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Good Flight with good price","They are good flight and respectful even the employee on the plane are professional and good.
The only problem you may face that the price does not include package and there ground employee in Amman Airport are not that professional. Most of the problem come that the price is not including any package and you must pay extra fees for the package.
Other than this its good and you can feel relax in there plane.",5,"2016",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Cheap Ticket But Not Worth It","I needed a one way ticket back to the UK so went with Pegasus. I was booked to London Gatwick via Sabiha Gokcen, the second airport in Istanbul. I paid extra to pick my seat and to get food on board. On my first leg from Doha they failed to bring my food until I asked for it, that said I wished I had not bothered, it was an inedible sandwich. As we were coming into land I could tell that the pilot had aborted and was performing a fly around. This continued for a while before an inaudible announcement was made from the flight deck. Non of the cabin crew were able to tell us what was happening. Eventually we landed at what must have been a military airport and were on the ground for about an hour without any clear communication from the crew. The language skills of the crew were very poor as was their general attitude. Eventually we took off again for a short flight to the correct airport by which time my connection had left. To say it was ciaos at the airport was an understatement. I managed to get to the front of the que to be told I was re-booked on the Stanstead flight. I fought my way through security and rushed to the gate just in time. Due to the fact they only carry pre-ordered food I did not have to eat another horrible sandwich. When we landed at Stanstead I went to luggage reclaim and waited. Once it was obvious my bag had not made the connection I went to the handling agent, Swissport. I reported my bag and was told it would arrive that night and would be forwarded on to me the next day, a Saturday. When Saturday came and no bag I spent 6 hours trying to get through to Swissport to be told that they don't send bags at weekends and it would be dispatched on Monday and delivered on Tuesday. Unfortunately I was driving to Paris on the Monday. This meant I had to make a 4 hour detour on my trip on the Monday morning to pick up my own bag. My advice is to avoid Pegasus at all costs.",5,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Gets the job done, affordable and value for money","We flew Pegasus Berlin to Tel Aviv with a layover in Istanbul. It's a low cost company so I didn't expect much. The one bad experience we had was when we arrived for the connecting flight, after literally running across Istanbul airport due to a delay. The flight attendant wasn't nice and after asking for a bit of water suggested we pay for it. We didn't have cash at all (we were returning from vacation...) and she didn't accept credit card for just a bottle of water or two. Eventually she gave us a 1/2 cup of plain water which we had to share.
Other than this disappointment, overall they got the job done and for a reasonable price. (The delay we had wasn't their fault, there was a jam in the sky over Istanbul)",5,"2016",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Late departure","We all face late departures but a simple sorry for 2 hours late departure is not enough, we had to eat, drink and call, so it cost a lot. A simple snack would be a nicw gesture but there wasn't any....",5,"2016",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","nightmare with cancelled flights and rebooking","I have had to spend 2 hours on 9 calls to Pegasus air and my travel agent trying to re-arrange a cancelled flight. Each time the agent, Travelgenio, told me Pegasus had to sort it out; Pegasus kept telling me that only the agent could sort it out. Eventually Pegasus re-arranged the flight (actually for my friend, I did most of the calls as I had booked and paid for the flights) which suggests they could have done it earlier. But I would have expected any competent travel agency to have simply talked to the airline firstly to sort it out and secondly to talk to the airline directly so as to prevent me as their customer being sat in a hotel lounge for 2 hours on 9 calls, caught in an impossible situation. And although the question of whether the flight was really cancelled or not remains unclear - the website shows it went but the airport when we got there this morning was not displaying it - you can only imagine sitting in a hotel in a foreign country trying to get home being passed back and forth between an agent - Travelgenio - and an airline who could not or would not talk to each other to sort this out.

this has been a nightmare. Flights get cancelled sometimes, I know, but this was awful. I suggest you never use this airline or Travelgenio. Ever.",4,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Horrible really horrible","It was a horrible experience,the flight PC462 was a connecting flight from Istanbul to Tbilisi,i flown from Vienna ,which was also pegasus airlines flight PC996,when i land in Tbilsi,1st of all they hold us in airport bus for a while,then when i get in the airport,i found out my baggages are lost,and it was freezing cold then in Tbilisi,i do not have any warm clothes with myself,i went to the lost and found centre,and explained them everything,they said ohh,no information available for your baggage,kindly fill up informations,i said i have all my winter clothes in the baggage,how am i supposed to live tonight,they remain silent.
when i come back to hotel,and contacted pegasus,they said no information available send the lost-found paper issued by airport and we will check.
after 1 day i get back my luggage.
when i called again their call centre,and spoken with this gentleman,named Mr Ali,and shared my problems that i faced and how can i avoid such situations in future,he said you are not the only one who faced that,there are other who faced it,so does he mean i was flying for free,i didn't pay for services,and then he said he has no solution for future mishap,jesus christ,i do not hear such horrible rude behavior before,world is not kind,and i guess he may be severely less paid by his employer,but that he should settle with his own employment company,why as a customer should face his horrible rude behavior.
In the end he said listen,if you do not hang up your phone,i will hang up mine..all the best Pegasus,bravo great staffs you get onboard,i suggest you teach them some etiquette..
if any one wants to contact me for further investigations please feel free,i can provide all files.It was a Turkish flying company and complaining them never result in any favorable response for international client.",4,"2016",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Not too bad, good for short flights","Flew this a while ago from Tel Aviv to Paphos and back. Not bad for a small airline and short flights. Planes are new, clean and sturdy. Could have nicer staff and food, not the best at all, but its not that bad!",4,"2016",3

Unfriendly, unprofessional and it is worse than EasyJet. I totally understand that it is a flight with no frills but we are still human beings. Most of the stewards have broken English and when we had a delay at the Istanbul airport to proceed to Egypt, they didn't bother to explain and/or apologise why we were on the tarmac for more than 1 hour. Only, when myself and some passengers (with children) start complaining as they didn't know that it was going on, that they tried to explain it to us as required. They've never used the loudspeaker to announce the delay and its reasons. I definitely never want to fly with them again. Not recommended.",4,"2016",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst Airline Ever","I will NEVER again fly this airline - EVER EVER EVER. I was flying from Madrid to Dubai with a transfer in Istanbul. I have a carry on suitcase that has never been a problem, always perfect size for every airline. I was waiting in line, in Madrid, at the gate when one of the people called me out and said to come to the counter. At this point they started speaking spanish and just took my bag. Didn't even say what they were doing or WHY..??? This is unacceptable. Anyway it seemed that my bag was ""too heavy"" which is what I am assuming since I was never told... so they checked the bag from there... My bag NEVER ARRIVED in Dubai like they said it would and was stuck in Istanbul.. I had to wait 24 hours for the next flight. THEN once they found the bag and the next day it was on the flight they said they would not deliver it to my hotel. WHAT? This is absolutely ridiculous. I had to spend over 75 US dollars to go all the way to the airport and back to get the luggage...And to top it off the aircraft itself like many people mentioned is SO CRAMPED. NEVER AGAIN and don't waste your money. Spend the few extra dollars for a better airline.",4,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Terrible custumer service, delays, big queues!","Our flight was delayed and we have arrived about 2hs late in Istanbul, so I missed my connection flight and had to rebook to a next flight.
Their service was horrendous. A huge queue with no organization at all, long wait, lame customer service's skills...
I finally managed it, but the next flight was only in another 2hours. So I would miss my shuttle to the hotel.
I tried to get help at their check in desk, but no one would help me.
I ended up having to take a taxi, which cost me a lot more!
I have complained to them and sent them the details of what happened.

"Pegasus-Airlines","flight to dubai from stansted","we needed a cheap flight to dubai, so we stumbled across pegasus airline, who we had never heard of before. Although we were expecting a budget experience this was beyond budget!! to say the least. The customer service was okay, not bad. But was a very plastic ky experience. The seats were smaller than small, made from cheap plastic, infant london transport seats are luxury compared to these. Claustrophobic atmosphere because the seats were too close, and too small. Furthermore, the oxygen level was minimal, and hence felt dizzy, and nauseous throughout the journey, Who ever plans to use this service, don't expect anything, that way you won't be disappointed!",4,"2016",1

"Pegasus-Airlines","Affordable Domestic/International Flights from Turkey","As a low-cost airline, Pegasus did not provide any on-board meals or entertainments for passengers. Spacing between seats and leg rooms are okay. Considering its price, you will find Pegasus very useful when travelling to different Turkish cities.

Be sure to use Pegasus Plus and the online check-in service, you will earn an extra few lira from it.",4,"2016",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Fly like a chicken!","Pegasus airlines must have the shortes leg room and smallest seats between the all airlines. I am 1.80 cm tall and I am quite fit. But it was really impossible to fit the seat and move. If you are a little bit overweight, if you are a little bit old and if you are not a very small person you will have real problems with this airline. God forbid if there is an accident like a fire or something, you will not be able to leave your seat easily. You must be well prepared for an emergency. Besides even one hour of flight will feel like a torchure.",4,"2016",1

"Pegasus-Airlines","Very pleasant flight - with great meatballs!","We flew to Istanbul with Pegasus - and flew back from Northern Cyprus with them. Both flights were pleasant and efficient. We had chosen our seats beforehand and pre-ordered our meals (highly recommended). We checked in online for the flight out (also recommended). There was hardly any wait to drop off our bags (and let's face it Stansted can be a nightmare!). All the staff were friendly and helpful. The plane was comfortable - with loads of leg room. And because we had pre-ordered our meal - we were served first! On the way back we had the choice of when to eat (on the leg from Cyprus to Istanbul or from Istanbul to Stansted). My husband said the meatballs he was served on the plane were the best of the whole holiday - and that's saying something!",3,"2016",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","It was better few years ago","I used to fly with pegasus airlines often (twice a year) due to its low prices and good service. However, recently the policy of pegasus changed. For example, if you have 2 hours of transit in Istanbul which is totally fine, the company will contact you 2 weeks before your flight to inform you that you have now 4 or 6 hours of transit.
It happened to me twice that's why i started preferring other airlines.",3,"2016",2

"Pegasus-Airlines","Very Bad airline","The flight I booked looked good on paper, with 2:30 hour wait in Sabiha-Gochen in Istanbul. 4 days before the flight the airline calls and adds 2 hours delay in Istanbul in each direction. So, instead of a ""bad"" flight we had the ""worst"" flight. I ask for a sandwich as compensation they said NO!!!!",3,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Cheap fares, but terrible","It was the cheapest flight I could book to London for my spring break.

Nothing extravagant to expect. Just a plane with seats that will take you from point A to point B. I just needed to get to London for my one week break.

Some of the flight attendants had a hard time understanding English. I wanted to place an order for my lunch, I called the attendant and she said she would come back, but never did. The legroom was to small (typical for a budget carrier). And in DOH-SAW leg of the flight, the cabin crew did not have change for a passenger who bought a meal, so they had to literally ask the other passengers if they can break the large bill into smaller ones.

I will travel with Pegasus again only if it the only available airline I can get when I am on a budget. Even if that should be the case, it will still be at the bottom of my list.",3,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Pegasus Airlines is very reliable","With Pegasus Airlines you can fly (e.g. from Düsseldorf Germany) to Istanbul Sabiha Gökcen Airport. From there to many destinations within Turkey or abroad. Pegasus offers a very good service and reasonable prices.",3,"2016",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","go for it if you have limited budget","it was a good flight. we had some delays almost in all flights. it was good for its price. no entertainment available.",3,"2016",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","up and away","After wnquiring as to the cost of rhe 13 hour intercity bus journey from Fethiye, 90Tl one way, I opted for a 9 day trip to the bustling metropolis. With the shuttle bus at 10Tl each way, and a return flight at 79Tl I booked a round trip at 99TL. My outward flight was delayed by 20 minutes but the return flight was, because of a tail wind, 10 minutes early. Whilst the mini trolley was pricey the service was excellent and the staff at both the airpots and in flight were extremely helpful. An all rpind good value for money and I look forward to travelling with Peagasus in the near future",3,"2016",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Speak as you fid","There are some dreadful reviews for this airline and I was nervous before travellig with them for the first time But I found the staff both on the ground and in the air to be friendly ,helpful and courteus.The plane was modern,clean and on time.They are at least as good as Easy Jet ( which doesn't say a lot about them) But as an economy airline I had no complaints about them at all",3,"2016",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Unique way of getting the safety instructions to passengers","Though there was a delay in the flight. The fact they used a children movie to get the safety instructions to the passenger.A very innovative to have the attention of the passengers.",3,"2016",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Be ready for surprises (in a negative way)","Sometimes I travel with Pegasus because of its cheap ticket policy. As an additional info, a delay occurs at least 30min. in your lucky day is possible for every flight. About my last experience, the plane belonged to Corendon (which my ticket is from Pegasus) but it has more comfortable seats than Pegasus. However, the problem is hosts could not serve any food even you want to buy. and they say there was a problem about carrying on the airport (!). Whatever, dont be hungry at the plane :)",3,"2016",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Pegasus Asia Airlines is OK","Flew from Bishkek to Osh and the flight was smooth and good. It was the first time I've ever seen how cabin attendant is offering and providing the plastic glass of water and asking for plastic glass back in few mins while you did not start to drink even LOL :D
Otherwise it was OK ))))))",3,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Cheap price but not cheap service","Well I traveled one time with Pegasus from Doha to Turkey. the seats are small and no DVD player to watch any movie. Seats were very uncomfortable and almost was sticking to a person sitting next to me. But good point is the Price you book, Pay less get worse LOL, kidding. Well somehow only good thing is a price and would add but attendants are good :)",3,"2016",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Special assistance not easily forthcoming, but flight was good","I needed the quickest journey possible from Northern Cyprus back to the UK so I booked Pegasus and hoped all the dreadful reviews wouldn't come true for me. I was delighted to find that the flight arrived early into Stansted. My seat was very comfortable, inflight meal was lukewarm but still nice, crew were quite polite. Overall, it exceeded my expectations.",3,"2016",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Surprisingly good flight, with good special assistance.","I'd read some awful reviews for Pegasus, but I needed the quickest journey possible from the UK to Northern Cyprus, so I booked and hoped for the best. I was amazed and delighted to find that the flight which was initially delayed leaving Stansted, then arrived perfectly on time in Ercan. My seat was very comfortable, inflight sandwich was really nice, crew were quite polite. Overall, it really exceeded my expectations.",3,"2016",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Not enough","My last flight with pegasus airlines was in 2015 from adb to madrid! I will never prefer this airline again.. They charge for almost everything.. Delay so long.. old aircrafts.. etc..",2,"2016",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst experience ever","We took a direct flight from London to Istambul, it wasnt that bad but adding what we ate during the flight we couldve taken Turkish airlines instead.
So, seats are ok, flight itself ok but... our luggage never arrived, how on earth can they loose a luggage in a DIRECT flight? Can someone explain it to me?
People at the airport barely know how to say hello in english and obviously didnt help us much, they lost it on the 17th and on the 19th-20th Gatwick airport sent me an email saying that they found my luggage, not even Pegasus but Gatwick!!
Still dont have it because Pegasus people are moroons (today is 26th) but hopefully now my luggage is in Amsterdam, far away from turkish people.
They should learn english and customer service behaviour, aslo as it is way too complicated to ask them for the refund, I am asking it directly to my insurance.
Will never fly again with them.",2,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Wouldn't particularly choose this airline again","No where near the standard of uk airlines. Cabin Crew seemed disinterested and spent a lot of time sat down and paying no attention to passengers. Safety demo on outward journey was done by tv screen and was like a cartoon that no one paid any attention to. I was travelling with small children and we have always used a debit card onboard with other good airlines but apparently this airline doesn't accept them?? Therefore my children were left on a 5 hour journey with no drink....... Even a small drink of water wasn't offered out of goodwill by the cabin crew even though they knew we had made a genuine mistake in taking no cash. Bit disappointed so won't be rushing to travel with them again .",2,"2016",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Try other options if available","The leg room is impossible to fit if you are over 180cm tall. Have to pay for online check-in and food. The worst landing I have ever experienced.",2,"2016",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Cheap flights, expensive call center","Very cheap flights but not more. Everything is extra, even calling the call centre to make transfers or just checking the flight. Web site provides very little functionality. Seat spaces are not for people taller than 185cm!",2,"2016",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","The most uncomfortable aircraft seats I have experienced","Out on a Wednesday and back on Saturday. On the way out, the standard safety briefing was omitted completely ad a half hearted attempt done on the way back.

This is the equivalent of RyanAir of Turkey with seats more closely packed. We booked a meal on the way out, which was served very early and was virtually impossible to eat in the cramped conditions. The cabin was also unbearably hot.

The flight back was late leaving and we sat on the tarmac for 40 mins due to congestion. Consider taking a cushion as the seats are so uncomfortable.

Strict security on the way out - but very lax on the way back. People travelling with more than one (largish) cabin bag. One traveller in the terminal was drinking from a 1.5 litre bottle of water. As you can only buy 300ml bottles in the terminal, it must have come through security - which is quite poor.

Please note that you cannot check in util 72 hours before your flight. If you want to chose your seat , you can do so and pay extra.",2,"2016",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Exceptional Budget Flights","A no-frills attached budget airline carrier service. You just cannot beat their prices. Simple operation to get you from point A to point B. This May (2016) i will be flying with them for the third time. The budget traveller will not find it any better than a Pegasus experience.",2,"2016",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","I was waiting for the worst and got a great surprise","Punctual, clean planes, excellent service, cheap tickets... I had read awful reviews that almost made me cancel my reservation. Instead I always departed on time and got an excellent in-flight service. Would definitely use it again.",2,"2016",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Great prices, very short waiting times at the airports","After flying Turkish Air for many years to visit family in Istanbul, Pegasus has been amazing! Their fares are much lower, yet their service is on par with other airlines and their lines at the airport were much shorter and faster than anything I have seen before. The short lines is what keeps us coming back!
Their airport in Istanbul is a bit out of the way by a few minutes drive, but if you avoid traffic hours, it really makes no difference.
I recommend ordering a meal when you book the ticket. It is much cheaper than buying on the plane and you for sure will get what you request.
We were travelling with a child and Pegasus were very professional about the stroller and the staff was all goo-goo-gaa-gaa with our toddler.",2,"2016",5
"Pegasus-Airlines","Cheap","Fleet based on quite new B737's. Standard discount airline. You pay for almost everything. NOTE Internet check-in boarding pass needs to be replaced at the check-in counter in CPH since this airport's scan technology is not compatible with the airline's",2,"2016",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Poor service, unpunctual departure and landing without apologising.","Flying in this company has been a terrible experience. A nightmare. Not departure in time and not landing in time too. Not good English speaking. Passengers taking hand luggage cabine before landing. Poor services at the airport for check-in and picking up the luggages at the airport too late. It is better you arrive in time and book your transfer with time. Although this company has good prices and interesting destinations I have waited more from them. Next time I will choose another company. Also my luggage is broken I have seen it when I have arrived at home sadly I didn't check it at the airport.",2,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","one of the best budget airways","a good budget airways, crews were nice and smiling and service was good. u can buy food by paying money. it was spacious and was very punctual.",2,"2016",4
"Pegasus-Airlines","Prices are good","I fly with pegasus inland domestic fligths because the airport is close to my home and its realy cheap to fly with pagasus. But you drink a glass of water you pay , you allowed only 15 kg laugage per person and if you have 16 kg you pay , shortly you pay for all the extras. Its like a charter airline.",2,"2016",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Not fot Tall people","Not recommendable for tall people (192 cm is my lenght) the seats got a bad posion for long legged persons my knees hit the seat in front of me,i will never book this airline again for a hollidayflight.",2,"2016",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","For Saving","If your are looking for saving on a short flight i recommend it , however in the departure flight from bahrain to Istanbul the air condition was turned off !!!! for 3 hours and the flight was full .

you have to buy the food and drinks and the prices are triple .

in the return flight we were late one hour in the airplane .
there is no entertainment at all no audio no tv no video .",2,"2016",2
"Pegasus-Airlines","Worst disaster handling ever in winter season","I travelled from Istanbul to Budapest with this airline on 31st of December 2015. It was such a disaster I should say.

- My plane was at 10:15 but they were delaying this time constantly without telling the reason to any passengers. It was snowy and icy yes. It is a drawback but not a drawback for letting people know what is the reason for delay. First the person who was responsible in a gate changed the gate number and left the gate without any information. After people went to the updated gate and whole passengers waited for any Pegasus employee to come and say what is going on exactly. For total of 1 hour delay no responsible was around gate. Eventually the delayed time arrived and the screen on gate shutted down itself out of ""no-action"". It means hundreds of passengers of flight PC457 was waiting on a gate where no flight assigned at all and no responsible around. It was humiliating. Eventually an employee arrived and they made the boarding. After another 10 minutes of delay.

- I have to say that all other airlines which has also delays at that time were handling situation with giving food and beverage to their passengers who stucked between gates and passport check counters. Strangely, I even clearly heard from speakers that Pegasus Airlines invited one of its delayed flight's passengers to Mc Donald's for free drinks in that time. But no free drinks for any other flights including PC457. I guess I will never know the reason of this double standard Pegasus Airlines enforcing to its passengers.

- Disasters are not over. At 11:22 we went to first Cobus' finally. But when plane completed the boarding, It just closed its gates and didnt move till 15:40! For more than 4 hours we waited for deicing process. Captains were giving incorrect informations or not information at all during this process. They closed the doors of plane and made us sit there for 4 hours and didn't even think to invite us for food or even single water! Flight crew itself were sick of the situation as well as passengers. It should have been cancelled if Pegasus was this much poor to handle the situation. Also, I have to indicate that I have never sit this much in my life without moving.

- We arrived to Budapest at 16:25 when I was supposed to be there at 11:35! Total delay was 290 minutes at least because if I count that I left passport check at 7:42, my total exposure to this disaster was more than 7 hours ""excluding"" the flight time... I wasn't smiling at the end that's for sure.

Don't use this airline ever if you didn't ran out of options. Wizz Air flies to Budapest cheaper most of the time and they provide more than they promise unlike Pegasus Airlines.",2,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","Cheap flight","the flight was good but we had to stay for several hours in Istanbul as a connection flight. nothing is served over the board. everything need to be paid extra",2,"2016",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Cheap flight but very low quality","There was a delay for about 2 hours and nobody anounced about this delay.
We asked to the Pegasus staff but they were very rude to us and didn't answer.
There was no excuse. It was really nightmare.",2,"2016",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","No frills, but gets you there","A no frills airline that nickel and dimes you to death if you let them. For example, coffee, tea, and snacks costs you. But they do get you where you want to go.",2,"2016",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Pegasus is a NO GO!","I would NOT recommend Pegasus Airlines! They are cheap but you get what you paid for .... and worse.

My flight was cancelled days in advance, I found out by chance the day before departure, and figured I would show up at the airport with the belief that I would be re-booked to another flight going to Instanbul that day (there were several others all though by competing airlines).

Once at the airport we were met by a check-in counter with the only message ""cancelled"" and ""call this number"". The number was for their call center in Instanbul. As I was located i Denmark and did not have a phone for international calls, I was left to faith. There were absolutely no help and we were all frustrated passengers. The information counter at the airport, which by the way have nothing to do with airline company, let us loan their phone out of their kindness and by their shocked observation over the level of service from Pegasus. After 3 hours, I succeeded to get through to their call center!!

I got two options: 1) to have a refund (and cancel my vacation) or 2) being re-booked to the next flight 24 hours after my original flight was scheduled for departure.

IMPORTANT: I was not offered a hotel or any meals during the 24 hour wait. Furthermore, under EU regulation, you are entitled to a compensation for cancelled flights. I have been denied a compensation by Pegasus Airlines. Currently, I have escalated a complaint to local authorities. So all in all, Pegasus Airlines DO NOT respect passenger rights which they even have listed on their webpage.

CONCLUSION: I will never fly with Pegasus Airlines again, even though they offer very competitive prices.",2,"2016",1
"Pegasus-Airlines","what you pay is what you get","what you pay is what you get..your luggage will always be damaged,so do not have anything fragile,moreover good value for money,taking in consideration that its the only low cost operating to Egypt",1,"2016",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Cheap travel","We've travelled with this airline many many times. They're cheap and that's just about all that can be said. Comfort is definitely not top of their list and they seem to have a vast range of planes from old to very old. The last flight we took was in what we presume to be, their oldest plane. The padding on the seats was very thin and not comfortable at all. The interior of the plane was very tired and did not provide a sense of safety, as there were many damaged areas around the windows and seating and some of the monitors were seized up. I am only 1.5 metres tall, and have never had any problem on other airlines with legroom. However, I always feel very cramped on Pegasus flights, it must be really uncomfortable for taller people. We have paid for extra legroom in the past, but there a very few of these and then it is not such a cheap flight. The ventilation is virtually non existent, so it is usually very hot whilst waiting for the plane to fill.
Only once, have we had a fairly new plane that provided comfortable seating. The only reason we keep returning, is that there are very few airlines who offer this direct route. I guess you get what you pay for.",1,"2016",3
"Pegasus-Airlines","Never Again!!!","The first thing I noticed was that the clerk at the check in was very rude. There was no greeting. She only looked up once just to verify that my I.D. was correct. I asked for a window seat and she mumbled something under her breath, I couldn't understand what she said but I could clearly see that she was frustrated with my request. Then I had a connecting flight in Istanbul. They would announce a time then it would be delayed this continued for a couple of hours. Everyone was lined up standing in this line for almost 3 hours. Overall it was not a good experience.",1,"2016",2
