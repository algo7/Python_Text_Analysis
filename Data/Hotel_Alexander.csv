"Hotel_Alexander","Overall - good experience","Great location, knowledgeable staff and good price. Located right at old town. Close to everything. 2 mins walking to a tram station. It is a good for a family with young kids. Free mini bar is a bonus.","Yesterday",,4
"Hotel_Alexander","Excellent choice in Old Town!","The location is the best asset of this nice, quiet little boutique hotel in Zurich's Old Town. Easily walkable from the main train station, it's also very convenient for exploring Old Town or crossing the river into more modern shopping areas. The hotel is very comfortable and cozy. This trip was a Father/Son adventure, and they were so kind to store our luggage as we arrived mid-morning from our Transatlantic flight. We were able to access our room by 11:00am, exceeding our expectations! We only stayed one night, but we also enjoyed the full (complimentary) breakfast. Every staff member we spoke with was very friendly, and knowledgeable. We highly recommend booking this hotel!",5,"2023",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Good Experience","This was a very nice hotel with a great location and wonderful staff. Check in was a breeze. Breakfast in the morning was wonderful and the staff that worked the breakfast were so attentive and nice. My only complaint was the bed was a bit hard and the pillows were so flat.",10,"6",3
"Hotel_Alexander","Zurich stay","We stayed only for 1 night and it met our needs perfectly. We loved the location as there were plenty of places to eat and places to see close by. There were three of us in the family room and we had enough space for our luggage. Beds were comfortable, breakfast was good with plenty of options and we stored our luggage at reception for the day so we could explore Zurich. Staff were pleasant and welcoming. We would stay again.",10,"2",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Wonderful place!","My wife and I stayed the the Hotel Alexander for 2 nights at the end of August, 2023. We LOVED it! We had a twin bed corner room and heard little or no noise from the street. The room was clean and well equipped. The staff was super nice, answering all our ""dumb"" questions. We found out Switzerland's electrical sockets are unique in Europe and the adapter we had didn't fit. Not a problem, the front desk loaned us one. Breakfast was delicious and served in a nice, bright room. There are plenty of restaurants within a 5 minute walk of the hotel and the train station was just 10 minutes away. If we're ever in Zurich again we will definitely stay here again!",9,"2023",5
"Hotel_Alexander","One night in Aldstadt...","We were warm and tired from our international flight and it was quite nice to arrive to friendly welcoming staff and a nicely air-conditioned room. We only stopped in Zurich for one night and wanted to stay in the Altstadt area. The location of the hotel is definitely what makes it worth the money, as the rooms aren't equipped with much extras and tend to be on the smaller side. Altogether, it fit our needs and we had an enjoyable stay.",9,"2023",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Convenient location, comfortable but small room.","The Hotel Alexander is located above a restaurant on a funky street in central Zurich, perhaps a 10 minute walk (or two-stop tram ride) from the central train station. The small lobby has room for only a few chairs. That the front desk would be closed (apparently for staffing issues) the first night of our stay was disconcerting. Our room was smallish but a generous wardrobe provided some space for luggage; other suitcases needed to be left on the floor where there was minimal open space. The bathroom was also small; there was a shelf by the window that provided plenty of space for toiletries, however. The room was immaculate and in excellent repair; like most of the hotel, it appeared to have been recently redone. Despite the snugness of our room, we may have gotten one",9,"2023",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Good and bad","This older hotel is in the old town which is a good location. However, there are a lot of tourists in this sector, so if you want some quiet location, you might think of another spot. Overall, I'd say I was disappointed. The front desk staff was a mixed bag with some friendly folks and others rude. The room I had was on the 4th floor and a bit warm. I had to request a fan even though it was air conditioned. Their system just couldn't properly keep it cool enough. There is no lounge and barely a place to sit in the front entry. The breakfast was adequate but seriously lacking in choices. Otherwise, it was clean and secure. I guess I'll harp on the people up front as a lasting impression and how the management should hire only people who enjoy meeting and caring for guests who",9,"2023",3
"Hotel_Alexander","Perfectly Placed","This hotel was booked by our tour operator and what a great option it was. It is a small, 'boutiquey type hotel', centrally located to most things - the main railway station an easy 10 minute walk away, restaurants at its doorstep and the centre of Zurich. The room was a very good size, with space to put suitcases without tripping over them (always a bonus) and the bathroom, small but functional(BYO soap). The facilities in the room were very good - excellent shower, comfortable beds, a safe, a bar fridge and as an added bonus, the first of each drink was complimentary. The air con was okay. The reception area was relatively small, but staffed by friendly and welcoming staff on all occasions. Drinking water and a supply of fruit was complimentary. The breakfast room was small,",9,"2023",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Friendly staff, great location","This hotel is in the heart of where you want be!!! Great location!!!! FRIENDLY STAFF… always very accommodating and eager to help. The host reception was nice enough to give us an early check-in since there was availability. We loved it here.",9,"2023",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Major Rip Off","A major rip off whether from Alexander hotel or booking.com. Both have ripped me off by charging my credit card for a cancellation that I have made prior to any deadlines. I had two reservations which I have cancelled both at the same time, but Alexander Hotel and Booking.com told me that I have cancelled one of them after the deadline. Booking told said that the cancellation was only by 30minutes after the deadline, and explained me this could be due to difference in time between where I live and Zurich. On the other hand Alexander hotel told me that I cancelled 8 hours after the deadline. Which of them is telling the truth? Or are they even telling the truth provided that I cancelled both reservations at the same time yet I was charged for only one. Also when I sent to ask",9,"2023",1
"Hotel_Alexander","Fantastic experience, Highly recommended","The hotel is in the middle of the Old Town, what was a perfect location for shops and good Restaurants. It was nice to have Apple and a coffee machine in the lobby. The staff was super friendly and helpful. We arrived before 1pm and the room was already ready for us. The room was clean and comfortable and the air conditioner was excellent. The breakfast was excellent with everything fresh.",9,"2023",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Clean, cozy, and everything you need in quite possibly the best location","Pros: Free minibar (once), Breakfast included, Exceptional location for tourists, Heat pump/air conditioning, Free coffee in the lounge, Strong water pressure, and Excellent customer service. Cons: Breakfast was adequate but not mind blowing, Room was small, but that is to be expected. Overall I am very happy with our stay!",9,"2023",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Perfect staff in the perfect location with comfortable and super clean rooms","There couldn’t be a more friendly, helpful and kind staff at a hotel than those at Hotel Alexander. None of my requests were seen as troublesome and every member was genuine in their desire to help guests and make them feel welcome. I needed a packed meal instead of breakfast as I was getting an early train. It was prepared with care and the reception staff made sure I had received it. The absolutely charming receptionist who I met upon arrival gave me a plus adapter, booked my alarm call and was pleasantly chatty. The room was very comfortable, spotlessly clean and soundproofed from the lively street below. The decor is generally of a 70s style although the bathroom is super modern and fitted to a high standard. There’s a new sign on the outside in the 60s/70s bubble font so",9,"2023",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Well located with friendly service!","Efficient room, great service. Ver nice breakfast to start your day in this well located hotel. Comfortable beds. Close to everything with friendly, cooperative staff. Would recommend as a great value.",9,"2023",4
"Hotel_Alexander","A perfect stay","Friendly helpful staff. They helped us getting familiar with Zurich city. Very clean hotel rooms. Delicious fresh breakfast is included. Centrally located to all shopping, sites and transportation. A perfect stay.",9,"2023",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Solo Traveler","What a lovely hotel. Location is wonderful, close to Zürich HB train station, shops and old world restaurants. Nice breakfast and AC!! Was able to check-in early. More importantly the helpful staff can mean so much when traveling solo!! Thank you!",8,"2023",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Outstanding hotel in Old Zurich","The hotel staff was outstanding. Reception was so helpful about everything we needed and asked about, including suggesting the excellent restaurant we selected for dinner. When I left an item in the hotel and had returned to the US, they immediately responded and sent the item on the same day. The hotel room was very clean, and well organized and arranged. Excellent location in Old Zurich. We enjoyed the breakfast, included in the room rate. Very fair rates. I would definitely recommend Hotel Alexander and stay here again.",8,"2023",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Love This Place","This hotel is in a great spot and is well appointed. The staff was super friendly and helpful. The room was very comfortable and the breakfast was as good as home cooking. I selected this hotel while at the airport because we didn't get on our flight back to the US and feel like I hit the lottery.",8,"2023",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Great hotel in convenient location","Great location in the heart of the Old Town, close to restaurants, public transport etc. The room was spacious for 2 separate beds placed a good distance apart, the was breakfast plentiful. Liked touches like free coffee or tea all day from a machine and free apples. The staff were all very friendly.",8,"2023",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Great place to stay!","Hotel: The location is excellent - very close to everything! We even had a little view of the river from our window. The rooms are well laid out. The bathroom is large and very functional. The included breakfast was excellent! Staff: Everyone we interacted with was extremely knowledgeable, friendly and happy to help! Overall, the staff is excellent! I highly recommend this hotel if you are looking for a clean, comfortable, conveniently located hotel with excellent staff.",8,"2023",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Excellent hotel option in Old Town","Excellent location in the center of Old Town, good service, comfortable room with air conditioning. Breakfast was included which saved us time in the morning. Room looked new with ample space and always clean. Bathroom was a bit small but acceptable.",8,"2023",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Location A Plus","As most reviewers have noted, this hotel is wonderfully located to explore Zurich. It’s an easy walk from the train station and a great place to start exploring Old Town. The room is quite small. The bathroom is airplane small. The shower has good water pressure and plenty of hot water. Unfortunately, our bathroom had a strong urine smell, which permeated the entry hallway to the room. The hotel is located on a busy pedestrian thoroughfare. Unfortunately, that thoroughfare is busy until the wee hours of the morning. Our room was on the 1st floor and we could hear people on the street below until we’ll past 3:00 am. We were told that the windows were soundproofed. I’m not sure that solves the problem. We could still hear late night revealers. In any event, the",7,"2023",3
"Hotel_Alexander","Great place and people!!","Hotel staff was very friendly! Hotel has everything you need if you need a small cute place to sleep and not spend too much time there. Great partnerships with bus and museum passes and zoo if you as at front desk. Marc was incredible and super kind!!!!",7,"2023",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Great Location","The location of this hotel can't be beat. Less than five minute walk to dozens of restaurants and bars, the main train station, the lake, and various bus/tram stops. The rooms were simple, but effective. Power outlets were Swiss, but they also offered a UK-style plug at the desk, very helpful! AC is included, but the controls are very simple. TV was small, but not a big deal. Mini-fridge is available in the room and everything that is in the room when you get there is yours to drink, then you pay for refills. This included two beers, two waters, a coca cola, and maybe a few other things. My room included breakfast each day which was always the same, but it was good. The breakfast staff were very friendly and we never had issues with the room being overcrowded. Overall, a",7,"2023",5
"Hotel_Alexander","No A/C, smells of smoke","Awful. Air conditioner did not work - I had to open the windows in July to cool the room. Room was minimally renovated, with 70s era rough plaster walls and old doors, etc. smelled of smoke. Do not recommend. $400 USD per night is an absolute joke. Better options exist in Altstadt.",7,"2023",1
"Hotel_Alexander","Safe, quiet well appointed hotel","Wonderful hotel in a quiet, safe street one block up from the river in old town Zürich. Beds were super comfortable, well appointed bathroom and very clean. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Great continental breakfast with lots of variety. Easy 15 minute walk from Zurich HB train station. Lots of restaurants and shops very close. Coop grocery store 5 minutes away. 15 minute walk to board boats to Lake Zurich and Bellevue tram station 5 minutes away. Highly recommend!",7,"2023",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Great Introduction to Zurich","Cleanest room. Hot shower. Delicious, plentiful breakfast. Helpful, pleasant staff. And very central location. The team/monorail is nearby, as is the river. Good restaurants and gelato right outside the hotel. The Chagall Windows at a nearby church was a bonus.",7,"2023",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Excellent hotel in an ideal location.","Location is ideal — only a short walk from the train station. Staff are exceptionally accommodating. Breakfast provides a good variety of food. Room and bathroom are small, but sufficient for two people. They have air-conditioning, which is not yet common in Switzerland.",6,"2023",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Great place to explore Zürich","Nice hotel located in the Niederdorfstrasse pedestrian street, in the old city. I had a single bed room on the top floor which was not too big but still cosy and comfortable. The hotel has a small breakfast room that offers a decent continental breakfast. The hotel staff is very friendly and helpful. Nearby are plenty of restaurants and pubs, all within walking distance. The Polybahn cable car that takes you to the beautiful historic ETH university is at only a few hundred meters away.",6,"2023",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Great value for money stay in Zurich.","Magic Mark at the reception was really helpful and went out of his way in order to be of service to me and my mother. He took care of our restaurant and taxi reservations! The hotel provided us with mobile Wi-Fi, with which was excellent and saved us a lot of time and effort.",6,"2023",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Good hotel in Old Town","Small room ( looks smaller than their picture) but super clean and very sound proof! Slept really well. Surprised by extra charge for extra person (2 total) and not restocking mini bar ( what’s in there is free) for the second night. Good location in old town with a few adult only venues close by that don’t bother. Would definitely go back",6,"2023",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Friendly, Helpful, Central Location","This hotel is super clean and comfortable. It is situated in the Old Town surrounded by a wide variety of food outlets and easy access to the waterways and New Town. The staff are friendly and helpful going out of their way to make your holiday experience as good as it can be. Nothing seems to be too much of a trouble to them.",6,"2023",5
"Hotel_Alexander","OK but not great","Positives: - Great central location - Very helpful reception staff - Clean room Negatives: - Felt overpriced for what you get - Breakfast disappointing - poor choice and quality, coffee not great, bread not fresh, scrambled eggs solidified - Very much just a room to sleep in, with nowhere to sit and relax",6,"2023",3
"Hotel_Alexander","Convenient, good,just a pity about that hum!","A low hum in the room which kept me awake, couldn’t trace it, otherwise fine. On a pedestrian street in old Zurich, plenty of restaurants near by. Car access a challenge but parking was offered. Good sized room with single and double bed. Good shower but a very narrow bathroom.Fridge has free bottled water. Breakfast was very good with plenty of choice. Excellent position for walking - or catching a tram - round Zurich. A stone’s throw from the river,",6,"2023",3
"Hotel_Alexander","Great location and wonderful staff.","Have just stayed at this lovely hotel and we can't recommend them highly enough. The staff were wonderful, providing us with an early check in and late check out plus a shuttle to the airport. Great location and everything we needed whilst in Zurich. Dance!",6,"2023",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Pluses and minuses","Pluses: very well situated hotel, very clean, friendly reception (except one young woman a little curt), not noisy at night despite being right over street cafes, good shower water pressure, free seltzer/spring water in lobby, eco bottle-sized toiletries. Minuses: room never got cool enough, very very thin towels, airplane sized bathroom, pillows either rubber ducky hard or overripe banana soft, soap/shampoo etc like something my grandmother would buy, only fair breakfast (ending up going to green gorilla around corner for excellent coffee, smoothies etc).",6,"2023",3
"Hotel_Alexander","Good place at a good location","Good place, good location, is on the side street in Old Town Zurich, not noisy but with lots of eating places. No hazzle in checking in and the receptionist staff were very knowledgeable and helpful. They were so friendly that we chatted everytime going in and out of the hotel. One of the Swiss gentleman at the reception (sorry missed his name) even offered to buy us a gelato. Great breakfast with lots of varieties. 8 mins walk to train station, we used it as a home base to other cities such as Lucerne and Bern and best of all Vevey - Charlie Chaplin's World - must see attraction. The hotel even provide discount tickets to go to the airport which is 10 mins away - easy peasy!",6,"2023",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Fantastic Budget Hotel in Central Location","Superb hotel if you’re on a tight budget in Zurich. We booked Hotel Alexander based on the reviews we’d seen online and were relieved to find it lived up to expectations. We received a warm welcome from the efficient and friendly staff. Our rooms were compact as you’d expect for the price but everything was immaculate and it felt very welcoming. The free minibar on our first night was very welcome and the Swiss beer excellent! We also really enjoyed the good breakfast served by friendly staff. Would thoroughly recommend this hotel.",6,"2023",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Great Stay in old town.","The Hotel is located in the heart of the old town. A 6 minute walk from the Central Train Station. The staff was wonderful. The included breakfast was delicious. Hotel has free tickets to the Zoo and main museum.",5,"2023",5
"Hotel_Alexander","As expected - good experience","Location was very good. Thought there could be a noise problem at night since so close to the action but it quieted down at a reasonable hour. Hotel was clean and staff was accommodating. Room and hotel in general felt cramped but I think that would be the normal trade off for being in a good location in old town.",5,"2023",5
"Hotel_Alexander","A wonderful compact hotel in Old Town Zurich!","Hotel Alexander is a wonderful compact hotel on the east side of the Limmat river in the Niederdorf area of Old Town Zurich. It is surrounded by intimate pedestrian lanes in both directions containing tens of restaurants and a few shops. It is not as “shoppy” as on the west side of the river where the national and global luxury brands have their stores. If you don’t demand the luxury surroundings of a more high-brow area, this neighborhood is for you! The staff at the Alexander were all to a person extremely friendly and accomodating. Most everyone I spoke with was bi-, tri-, or quadri-lingual (put my bi-lingualness to shame!). They have a great little breakfast that should please both european and north american travellers. Standard rooms are quite small by north american",5,"2023",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Saturday in Zurich","My wife and I enjoyed our one-night stay at Hotel Alexander. We liked the location. It's a short walk to the station and many other sights and attractions. The lively nightlife below was no problem for sleeping and the beds are comfortable. We had a second story room with a view of the street below with large windows you can open. Service at the front desk and at breakfast was great. Very good value, accommodations and location.",5,"2023",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Great hotel in many ways, shame about the breakfast room","Hotel had an excellent location, room very clean. Hands down the most incredible European bathroom I have ever experienced - shower was super strong & got hot, no issues w/ taps or toilet or anything. Safe in the room, very quiet. Most staff at the front desk very friendly & helpful, altho there was one snippy woman. May have been a language issue? . Lots of english language programming on the TV. Reason I am just rating this average instead of very good is because of breakfast & the breakfast room. . Breakfast was very basic but good. The breakfast room was very small & crowded. I am travelling alone and I am visually impaired (I use a white cane). There were always 2 staff in the room, but on only one morning did anyone assist me in finding a table. I would stand in the",5,"2023",3
"Hotel_Alexander","Good Hotel","Overall a good hotel. Staff was excellent, very friendly. Rooms are a bit outdated and could use better soundproofing as well. However the room was clean. Nice perk that the minibar was included, that was very convenient.",5,"2023",4
"Hotel_Alexander","5-star service in old town","I stay mainly at 5 star hotels during my travels. The service at this and the generosity of the staff exceeds other hotels that are much higher rated. I would highly recommend anyone wishing to stay in old town to stay here.",5,"2023",5
"Hotel_Alexander","A great little find","Excellent hotel in a great location. Close to main train station and right in the midst of the old town shops and restaurants. Room was modern with large single beds. Breakfast was great and all staff were helpful and friendly. Would definitely stay again.",4,"2023",5
"Hotel_Alexander","One night at Hotel Alexander","We enjoyed our brief stay at Hotel Alexander in Zurich. The room was clean and the bathrooms were modern. The front desk was helpful. It was in the old part of the city and close to restaurants and activity. More importantly, it was a short walk to the train station. I recommend staying there.",4,"2023",5

"Hotel_Alexander","April 2023 Review - Hotel Alexander - Zurich","-Arrival - The driver transported us as closely as possible (to the hotel) as the front of the hotel is limited to pedestrians only. Rolling several pieces of luggage on a cobblestone street was a bit of a challenge. -Check-In - A lady greeted us professionally and kindly. As we had paid for the room in advance, she provided the room key, information about WiFi, details about the breakfast, and how to access the hotel using a code after certain hours. Upon seeing the amount of luggage we had, she asked if we would want to leave some suitcases we did not need in a storage area on the first floor. I inquired about possibly upgrading to a larger room, and she then insisted twice that I, not she, booked my original room on the Internet. This statement was conspicuous. I was not",4,"2023",3
"Hotel_Alexander","Recommended","Family-friendly hotel. Very welcoming and hospitable staff (especially Katarina and Shaun).. Kettle is provided on request.. All basic facilities in the rooms.. A basic but delicious breakfast, served with love.. The room and washroom sizes are quite small, but okay for a short duration.. The location is exemplary.",4,"2023",4
"Hotel_Alexander","A Swiss Carm","I was so pleased with the Hotel Alexander! It is a perfect location for enjoying the old part of Zurich. The staff was so helpful and courteous. They went out of their way to make things just right. The rooms are basic but clean and comfortable. I hope to return to Zurich and if I am fortunate enough to do so, I will return to the Hotel Alexander!",4,"2023",5
"Hotel_Alexander","The best staff!!!!","The staff was absolutely amazing in every way!! We had to leave before breakfast the following morning so they prepared breakfast to take with us when we left. They gave us a free mobile hot spot so we had wifi as we went throughout the city. The rooms were clean and comfortable with a great view. The location could not have been better. I would absolutely stay there again!",4,"2023",5

"Hotel_Alexander","Exceptional","Friendly staff and manager. Nicely furnished with all necessary appointments. Perfect location. Close to great restaurants and stores. Thoroughly enjoyable experience! Highly recommended to you whenever you are in Zürich! You cannot do better!",3,"2023",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Zürich - convenient classic hotel","This hotel is very convenient - easy walk to the train & in/adjacent to Old Town. A classic small hotel - rooms more than adequate & do include a desk, plenty of hanging space and some shelves. The lighting is good. Unfortunately they are hot and noisy and the milk glass bathroom door while perhaps trendy, is annoying to those trying to sleep. We left too early to enjoy the breakfast. So, it was nice to fine croissants & a coffee machine in the lobby. The staff were fabulous - so kind and thoughtful.",3,"2023",3
"Hotel_Alexander","Small cramped rooms but good location","Friendly staff and clean rooms don’t compensate for the size of rooms. This is a small hotel in a city centre location but even for an overnight stay it all feels cramped. On the plus side the beds are comfy with the best pillows of any hotel on our Swiss trip and the rooms are modern.",3,"2023",3
"Hotel_Alexander","excellent and central hotel","The hotel is very well located, the attention is excellent and the breakfast is very good. the beds are also very comfortable and the hotel is quiet. There is also a boy who speaks Spanish I recommend it",3,"2023",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Super Central - Great breakfast - nice and helpful staff - a jewel at the heart of town","Fantastic experience. Super centrally located in the old part of town. Parking available around the corner. Excellent breakfast (incl Bircher Müsli and scrambled (real) eggs. I had a small but beautiful and clean room to the street which es a little bit noisy at times. But I read that rooms to the inner court are quiet. Super friendly and helpful staff. Next time in Zurich I’ll stay here again.",3,"2023",5

"Hotel_Alexander","Location,location, location!","The Hotel Alexander exceeded our expectations. We arrived after a long overseas journey and we were grateful that our rooms were ready for an earlier check-in. The receptionists were very friendly and helpful. The rooms were comparable to NYC size rooms and had everything we needed. The beds and pillows were super comfortable. The location of the hotel is great - within walking distance of Zurich HB train station and is surrounded by restaurants and shops. We were visiting during carnival so the trade-off of being in such a central location is some street noise. The breakfast selection was excellent for our group, including a vegetarian. We are planning to stay again at the Hotel Alexander on our way home.",2,"2023",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Great as always","I am offen here for my business trips and the staff is as friendly, helpfull and kind as always. The rooms are clean and cozy. The selection at the breakfast buffet is big and there is something for everyone.",2,"2023",5

"Hotel_Alexander","Have an unique experience within the city center","I really like this Hotel. I am here once a month, and every time I enter the hotel, the staff welcomes me with a smile. I have the feeling that the team spirit there is very strong. About the rooms: the bed is very comfortable and so is the pillow. I also like the design & what is very important for me is the cleanliness. Therefore, I can totally recommend this hotel.",2,"2023",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Convenient location","The hotel front desk people are friendly. Check in was easy. There is free coffee, tea and apples in the entrance area. No fridge in the room nor tea kettle. Breakfast was not fancy but decent. Everything is very basic but clean. Walking distance to everywhere and plenty restaurants you can choose. My room 305 is facing the street and noisy in the morning when the restaurants are getting ready for the day. Overall, Switzerland is expensive. If you have a budget, this hotel can be a good choice.",2,"2023",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Great!","Loved it, so close to the center and you can walk everywhere or for longer distances the train is 3-5 minute walk from the hotel! Originally booked for the guesthouse but they updated my stay to the hotel. Clean, comfy beds. Will be coming back for sure.",1,"2023",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Quick stop in Zurich","Hotel was just as advertised; a comfortable, refurbished, small hotel in an older neighborhood on a pedestrian-only cobble stoned street. Nice staff, ample European breakfast. Short walk to the train station (Zurich HauptBahnhof). Heads up: you can’t pick your neighbors - there are lots of casual restaurants on this street, some really nice upscale dining spots, a head shop and an adult entertainment venue. I reconciled it to staying near Times Square in NYC and I’m OK with that. Lots of friendly people walking about, especially young students. I’d stay there again.",1,"2023",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Fantastic location","The location is fantastic with heaps of restaurants and bars right outside. The room was well sized, modern, clean and comfortable. The staff were also super helpful and friendly. We'd happily stay here again.",1,"2023",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Just what we needed","Situated in a great location of the Old Town of Zurich, one cobblestone street away from the river and walking distance to the main Zurich train station. Plenty of dining options right at the doorstep. We stayed on the 4 floor which is the top floor. The room had a real attic feel to it that we loved and had been designed to make the most of the space. Beds and pillows were very comfortable Great atmosphere and staff were very helpful. The minibar included on arrival was an unexpected but welcome surprise. Would definitely stay at Hotel Alexander again when we next visit Zurich!",1,"2023",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Really Small Rooms","Rather inconvenient to walk to this hotel from the train station with the cobbled streets. The wheels of your luggage might be damaged and I am serious about this. Rooms are very small so don't expect to have room to walk around after opening out your luggages (i stayed in a room for 2). It is clean and comfy though. No problems with showers and a good night's rest. Breakfast is very basic though.",12,"2022",3
"Hotel_Alexander","a pleasant stay in Hotel Alexander","All as described in the website. Room confertable and breakfast absolutely good. Very helpful and nice staff. We were pleasently surprised about coffe/tea/water available at the entrance of the hotel. A very pleasent stay in Zurich",12,"2022",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Hôtel Alexander Best hotel in the old city of Zurich","I thank Mr. Abdou very much for his warm welcome and his availability and kindness, as well as all the hotel staff. The hotel's location is well located in the old town of Zurich, 5 minutes from the train station, not far from the city center and department stores. Very clean, varied breakfast, there is everything you need. Free mini bar. I can only recommend this hotel. Thank you for everything, Mr. Abdou",12,"2022",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Convenient location in Old Town","Of the three places we stayed in Switzerland, this had, by far, the tiniest rooms, but they were sufficient offering anything you may need. The breakfast was good and the service was friendly. The hotel was generous and allowed us to store our luggage there for a couple of days before we arrived which made our trip so much easier. That was greatly appreciated!",12,"2022",4
"Hotel_Alexander","In the heart of Zurich!","You couldn't be more centrally located than here! In the heart of Zürich, Hotel Alexander is an easy-going hotel with everything you need. The staff is super friendly, fun and ready to help with whatever you need (including excellent local tips). I've been here for business, but I could easily imagine coming back for leisure and making the best of my time in Zürich. Thank you to the team for this lovely stay!",11,"2022",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Convenient, Clean, and Helpful!","Our stay was very comfortable. We were only in Zurich for a night, but the hotel was very accommodating, happy to assist us, and answer any questions we had about the area. We were also given a free wifi hotspot for the city which was a nice plus!",10,"2022",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Just okay.","The hotel is clean but has no AC. We couldn’t open the windows because it then gets too noisy. The hotel is located in restaurants and bars areas. The breakfast was okay with limited selection. I wouldn’t stay here again. I don’t think we got what we paid for.",10,"2022",3
"Hotel_Alexander","Perfect Location! Highly Recommend!","The location of this hotel was perfect!! Walking distance to literally everything and only 5 mins walking to Zurich HB Train Station! Marc was so helpful and when I arrived at the hotel he said they upgraded my room to a business room as I was staying for 10 nights and wanted to be located in a quieter section of the hotel. The bed is very comfortable and the room I was in was very spacious. The shower pressure was great and storage space was good! The breakfast was so good and there’s a wide variety of food and drinks! There’s an elevator which is great for luggage. I loved the hand soap and the shampoo too! Housekeeping is great as well. Everything is clean and tidy! Loved my stay here!!",10,"2022",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Highly Recommend","+: It was easy to get to from the station - just a few minutes walk. There are lots of shops around. The staff were very accommodating. The room is quite spacious and very clean. -: One of the receptionists was a little rude. She looked unhappy when she had to help me with the coffee machine. There should’ve been a kettle. It doesn’t cost much.",10,"2022",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Convenient and friendly stay.","The location is perfect as it is situated in the heart of city centre of Zurich among cosy cafes and shopping centres. We enjoyed the range of Asian restaurants in and around the location. The hotel has friendly and helpful staff at the reception. The breakfast was amazing too!",10,"2022",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Helpful staff","The stall are exceptionally helpful, nothing too much trouble. Rooms are small but position is excellent. Free tea coffee and fruit are available in foyer, you can book all your tours and the staff knowledge is very good",10,"2022",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Weekend in Zurich","We had a pleasant weekend at Hotel Alexander in the Old town section of Zurich. The location was perfect as we were within walking distance of all the attractions, shopping, and restaurants. We were also close to the main Zurich train station. Room was comfortable and clean. Staff accommodated us when we needed to stay another night. Breakfast has plenty of options and provide a good start to the day.",10,"2022",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Absolutely amazing hotel hidden in downtown Zurich!","Really nice hotel. Downtown location. Really friendly staff. Everything here in Zurich is very close and walkable. Situated in the best part of town. Close to restaurants and the main shopping streets. It is easy to get to the train station. It is a really lovely area with lots of side streets and alleys. Katarina was really smart and helped a lot.",10,"2022",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Midpriced hotel in a great location","Reviews In Old Town near a Coop and Starbucks and in a University district. Small lobby, small room, but comfortable bed and very quiet if you face a courtyard. Nice breakfast, included in the cost, and the server was amazing. Recommend crossing the bridge and finding your way up historical Lindenhof Hill at sunset to see the lights in the city turn on.",10,"2022",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Is this what 300 Swiss francs gets you at the Hotel Alexander?","It was very difficult to find a hotel in Zurich during the film festival so when a room popped up at the last minute for our last night in Switzerland, I booked it at more than 300 Swiss francs for one night. The Hotel Alexander is a “Travelers Choice” so, while I wasn’t expecting luxury I thought that it would be a safe bet. Unfortunately, I stayed in better places while backpacking in Europe in the late 1960s. Our small room had two single beds at the opposite side of the room, the bathroom was tiny. The “desk” was barely a small triangle and the desk chair was the only place to sit on besides the beds. The complimentary mini bar had four bottles of water and two cans of beer and the warning that it would not be replenished during your stay. I gave the Hotel Alexander two",10,"2022",2
"Hotel_Alexander","In my oppinion is overated","Room has a good size. Reception staff was friendly and helpful. Very good breakfast, person in charge was very dynamic to keep all items always available. Bathroom very small. The door that connects the room to the bathroom is glass made and tranparent. During the night if you go to the bathroom, your roommate will be awaked. Beds not very comfortable. Low quality towels. Very noisy, for two nights, about 3:00 am, we could hear screams from the street.",10,"2022",3
"Hotel_Alexander","Good location BUT.","Last week while in Zurich my wife and I stayed at the Alexander. The reason we choose this hotel is because of the location. At the check in the three people behind the counter didn't seem to have our best interest in mind. One was trying to check us in while the woman was contradicting him. Another man was trying to talk to us about the weather while we were trying to listen to what was happening with our check in. Got checked in and got to the smallest hotel room I believe I have ever had. We had been in Switzerland for 2 weeks and stayed in several hotels and this was by far the smallest. Materials like towels and bed linens we of lesser quality than others. We were on the first floor and the room was very warm. Tried opening the window but the noise from the street",10,"2022",3
"Hotel_Alexander","2 night stay at the Unique Hotel Alexander","This is a 60 year old hotel built with 200-300 year old wood. It is heavily carved and each room is unique. Service is excellent. The buffet breakfast is wonderful and includes honey comb honey. Our room had a lovely balcony. The bed was very comfortable and the entire experience felt like we were really in the Swiss Alps which is where we were. It is fairly close to the cogwheel train that goes to the top of the Gornergratt - a stunning experience.",9,"2022",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Clean, very nice staff all around, great location","Cute boutique hotel, very clean and the staff is kind and attentive all around, breakfast room is well maintained and the complimentary breakfast buffet has a lot of options that are always fresh and refilled proptly, the housekeeping is fast and very clean and the reception desk helpful and informative. Clear recommandation👌",9,"2022",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Disappointing","Centrally located hotel in the center of old town. Small dated rooms. No air conditioner. Can not open the windows because you are on a very loud corner with teenagers screaming and drinking all nigh long. No amenities at the hotel and breakfast is average. No concierge service either. Doesn’t look like there is a shortage of small boutique hotels in the area so I will be staying somewhere else next time.",9,"2022",3
"Hotel_Alexander","Great base for Zurich","My husband and I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights recently and enjoyed our stay very much. The staff at check in was very thorough in explaining things. We got an upgrade to a king room which was very nice so we has a little more space. Breakfast was included and it was great. The ladies in the breakfast room keep everything supplied and coffee flowing. There was always coffee, water and fruit near the front entrance which was nice. The bathroom was nicely set up and clean. The Mini bar was free of charge on the first round which is more than I have gotten anywhere else. The hotel is in the old town area so there are a lot of eating places and bars around. The only negative I can come up with is the lights in the hallway come on with a motion detector which you will get light",9,"2022",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Switzerland Birthday","Excellent staff. Excellent location. Small boutique hotel in busy Old Town. At time of my visit they provided breakfast which was fabulous, recommend their muesli. They provided free of charge coffee, water, apples and hot spots. Helpful with directions and cab service. Highly recommend.",9,"2022",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Time in Zürich","Really friendly and helpful staff, very nice room with shower and a great Pizza place around the corner. Central location easy walking distance to everywhere including the ETH (mind the steps). All in all an excellent location at a (for Zürich) reasonable price.",9,"2022",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Lovely well located hotel in central Zurich","Great location, friendly staff and excellent amenities. We had a great short visit to Zurich and this hotel helped make it better. It is centrally located and within easy walking distance to many local attractions. Also a short walk to the main Zurich train station and many local teams. Highly recommended.",9,"2022",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Best hotel in Zurich","Excellent location, close to all downtown activities and within easy walk of the Rail station, stores and restaurants. Buffet breakfast was superb, beds comfortable and room clean. This family run hotel is well appointed with great staff especially the always helpful and knowledgeable front desk staff. Modern and convenient.",9,"2022",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Vacation","Stayed two nights before meeting my tour in Luzern..I’m a return customer.. great service.. and comfortable.. located in a great area.. and I walked from the train station..highly recommend.. nice breakfast included!!",9,"2022",5
"Hotel_Alexander","In the Heart of it All","The Hotel Alexander is a small, mid-priced hotel located in the heart of Zurich. Zurich, I should add, is not that big, so pretty much every hotel is in the heart of Zurich. There's not much of a lobby (it consists of one sofa) but that’s ok. Rooms are compact, well designed, and quiet. Buffet breakfast was of good quality, if a bit limited in selection. Friendly, attentive service.",9,"2022",4
"Hotel_Alexander","My Holiday in Zurich.","Dear everyone, I'm from Singapore, travelling as a single, older professor lady tourist. I booked my flight, hotel and day trips through the Expedia app. I must say, I am surprised how easy it was. Good value for money, wonderful hotel, location, ambience and service. Yours sincerely, Sarina Omar",9,"2022",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Excellent choice for Zurich stay","Stayed at this hotel for four nights. The bed was super comfortable and the room was quiet. Breakfast was very good with real scrambled eggs (not powder), bacon and non pork sausage, and a great Meusli. Hotel staff was extremely pleasant and helpful, offering suggestions for tours, umbrellas, and adapters for iPhone charging. My only suggestion: Perhaps staff could be more familiar with the out-of-the-way restaurants for visitors who don’t want the typical tourist restaurant. The location could not be better!",9,"2022",5
"Hotel_Alexander","No Way Out!","This was our second stay at Hotel Alexander. The first stay was fine. We chose to return as we were leaving the next morning to return home and felt it was easier to stay there and walk back to the train station early the next morning. There was a street fair going on with numerous food, drink and music set-ups. We informed them that we were leaving early and would not be able to have breakfast. The staff said they would furnish us with a breakfast and leave in our room. This did not happen! Next, they placed us in a room next to a Reggae band which started at 8:00pm until 2:00am. Non-stop loud drums and screaming. I called the front desk to complain with no help. They could not move us as they were full. I requested a credit and got nothing. We left feeling like zombies, no",8,"2022",2
"Hotel_Alexander","Alexander Hotel, Zurich","A wonderful hotel, well located in Old Town Zurich! Superb staff at all levels, extra clean and a fabulous breakfast included! One rather unique item was a mobile wifi device offered that could be carried in your pocket or purse and would provide internet service anywhere in Switzerland!",8,"2022",5
"Hotel_Alexander","A lovely hotel in fab location","Stayed one night, 10-15 min walk from main train station. Would stay again. Room was small but very well maintained - really like the different power adaptors for international travellers, free mini-bar and thoughtful touches like a proper hair-dryer and complimentary toblerone on the pillows! TV selection did not have many English channels but wifi was good. Complimentary water and fruit in the lobby was useful. I thought the breakfast let it down a bit - pastries and cereal selection standard but fine, however the hot food was very average.",8,"2022",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Excellent","Great hotel in the heart of Old Town Zurich. Located right on a pedestrian cobblestone street filled with restaurants, cafes and little stores. It’s approximately a 10 minute walk to the train station. Super clean room with all amenities. Good buffet breakfast. Friendly staff. Air conditioning works well. Wifi is free but it can be spotty at times. Highly recommend this cute hotel.",8,"2022",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Good location. Friendly staff.","We only stayed in Zurich for one night. This hotel is in a convenient location, close to major sites, restaurants and the airport. We have free minibar, which is a good surprise. Breakfast is good. I asked for a room facing the courtyard and it was quite, which is a requirement for me as I am a light sleeper. There is free parking but you need to reserve ahead of time as the parking space is limited.",8,"2022",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Rva","Good located, near old town. Near everything - shops, restaurants, Zürich lake. Easy come to hotel from airport by tram. Very clean hotel and very good noice isolating. Receptionists and all staff very friendly.",8,"2022",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Excellent location and staff - just don't get 4th floor!","As others have said, the location in Old Town can't be beat. Also, close to Zurich H.B. for arriving and departing by rail. I've stayed in Zurich before, the first time at a different hotel, and no one spoke English. Here, at Alexander, everyone spoke very good conversational English (not that I expect people to know my language in their country, but it's very helpful, especially if you have issues). Having stayed in Zurich before, I know about the small hotel rooms. In fact, the one I had at Alexander was larger than the one from last trip. One negative: My God, those 4th floor rooms, LOL!! They have arches that, unless you're under 4' tall, you going to concuss yourself on. I almost never ask for a room change, especially if it's just an overnight stay, but I was genuinely",8,"2022",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Location Is Perfect","Spent the last two days of a two week trip to the Swiss Alps in Zurich. Hotel Alexander was exactly as advertised. Charming streets and shops were literally blocks away, the restaurants in the area where fantastic. Bahnstrasse was across the river it is a 10 minute walk. The hotel was clean the continental breakfast worked great and the staff was most helpful.",8,"2022",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Friendly staff, clean room","Spacious room by city standards, very clean. Several extra perks like drinks in frig and chocolates on pillow. Staff was friendly and helpful. Convenient location for shopping and sightseeing. Definite thumbs up!",7,"2022",5
"Hotel_Alexander","The Heart of the Altstadt","If you want to experience the old town, Zurich, then you have found your spot. This hotel is located in the heart of the old town with everything within walking distance around it. Restaurants are literally just outside the doors. The river is a block away, and all of the attractions are easily reached by foot. The rooms are clean and comfortable. The mini fridges are stocked with complimentary drinks. Breakfast, included, is quite good, with a large fresh selection, including fruits. The hotel also offers 24/7 fresh coffee, tea, and fruits. The staff feels like family. They are nice to chat with and will do everything to make your stay as pleasant as possible.",7,"2022",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Quiet modern clean rooms - good breakfast - great location","Really helpful, friendly welcome at the front desk on our arrival. Our two twin rooms were spot on. Just what we needed after a long train ride on the Bernina Express. Very comfortable and quiet. For business travel I had always been booked into the Schweizerhof but never slept well there. The location of the Alexander is much better. Only 10mins or less from the train station, more peaceful and much better value. My night at Hotel Alexander was the best nights sleep I've ever had on many trips to Zurich. And to top it off there's a free minibar - perfect after a long day !",7,"2022",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Great location, very helpful staff","This was our first stop after a long international flight. It's perhaps a 6-8 minute walk from the main train station, with luggage. Suggest you use roads by the river to get there, because the inner cobblestone roads are hard on luggage wheels. Location in old town is great! You can walk to most scenic areas. Lots of restaurants close by. The staff were welcoming and helpful. The nice shower (we had only a shower, and that's our preference) was great after a long flight. Loved that I could get coffee in the lobby in the early morning before breakfast started. Breakfast had plentiful offerings and was good. We had a double & single bed because we wanted a room with a little more space. My only complaint is that the corners of the bed have metal on them. Both of us",7,"2022",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Amazing!","Everything was flawless! Also the location is perfect everything is on walking distance of 15 minutes! Staff is nice and helpful. We loved our stay and would definitely visit again during our next visit!",7,"2022",5

"Hotel_Alexander","All you need","We enjoyed our one night stay here prior to flying out of the Zurich airport. We went with one of the basic rooms as we knew we really weren't going to be spending much time in it. Everything was very clean, people were very nice. Good breakfast.",7,"2022",4
"Hotel_Alexander","a very comfortable place in a great location","we stayed in this hotel for 2 nights and we really enjoyed of everything: the great location in the middle of the old town, the nice and the comfortable room, the very good breakfast , the helpful staff, so we warmly recommend it",7,"2022",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Heart of old town","5 great location great service, very helpful with things to do and places to go. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone we were in the heart of everything. We walked everywhere. Hotel has a lift which is very convenient specially for international travelers",6,"2022",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Great Location and Free Portable Hotspots!","Fantastic hotel in the heart of Zurich! The hotel staff was so kind and friendly and they offer portable hot spots for international travelers so you have wifi all day long. The rooms were clean and the breakfast was made fresh every morning. The rooms are a bit tight for two people, but you won’t be in your room much because you’ll be enjoying Zurich! If you want to stay on a lively street (but in a quiet hotel room) and be conveniently located to everything, then stay at the Alexander hotel! I would highly recommend to all those who are looking for a great place to stay while you are out doing things in the city everyday.",6,"2022",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Best location and super service","This hotel served us on our first and last day in Switzerland whilst we explore the alps. The location is perfect for all you wish to do from Zurich. The HB, Kunsthaus, lake trips and restaurants galore all with easy walking distance. Staff genuine, passionate and alway willing to assist where possible. Thanks for the great stay👍",6,"2022",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Ideal accommodation to explore Zurich","Hotel Alexander is strategically located in the ""old town"" with many tourist attractions within a few minutes of walking. The main station and bus station is close to the hotel which provides the opportunity for organised excursions (typically day trips) of the Zurich area and further. Easy access to hotel from Zurich Airport with Taxi or train service. Excellent breakfast buffet and very helpful and friendly staff. Do booking of accommodation timeously to avoid disappointment.",6,"2022",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Made especially comfortable with sparkling water machine, and mifi machines for borrowing","We had a great time, and experienced a group of people who make up the staff here. The sparkling water on demand machine made the hot summer much more pleasant! The location is very pleasant and has a real charm!",6,"2022",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Excellent service, clean , breakfast, helpful desk, well situated in old town with full of restaurant in the same street","Well situated in a pedestrian only street in old town Zurich. Full of restaurants around for all wallets. Nice service, helpful front desk, clean, good breakfast , don’t need to lunch so you save money. Room and bathroom are renovated, a little bit small but you are in the middle of old town what is superb. Only suggestion, the stock in the frigo is free but if you want refill you paid. I considered this non sense because if you stay one night you are allowed for free but if you stay as in our case 4 nights and you still having only one frigo stock for free. It is always comfortable to arrive to the hotel after a long day of walking and to have a cold beer or coke ready. We recommend 100% this hotel.",6,"2022",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Amazing stay","Amazing stay, delicious breakfast, friendly staff, great location, and some small surprises. 10/10 in all the boxes. It was a great start to our journey. Will definitely stay here if we visit Zurich again. Special thanks to Rina for swift checkin and warm welcome.",6,"2022",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Amazing value - great hotel","I can’t say enough good things about Hotel Alexander. It’s an amazing value for the price. Location is great, staff is friendly and helpful, and a very good breakfast is included! Our room was upgraded for free as well which was a nice surprise. Plus we saved almost 100 francs thanks to the hotel’s tickets to the Kunsthaus and Zoo that you get to use for free. Also stayed here over a weekend, yet our room was very quiet all night even though it’s a busy part of town",6,"2022",5

"Hotel_Alexander","Hotel Alexander The Great","I’ll make this clear: this place is not 4-star accommodations but I’m giving it 4 stars! The staff were super friendly and helpful. They exchanged currency for me, gave me power adapters, instructed me as to the closest place for a covid test, drew out a map of all the best landmarks near the hotel and greeted me with a smile every time in and out! The best part of this hotel is it’s location. It sits about a 10 min walk away from Zurich HB, the main train station and just walk out your door and you’ll find a ton of bars, restaurants and convenience stores.

A basket of apples, water and a coffee machine were in the entrance hall. The reception staff were charming. We would certainly recommend the Alexander",6,"2022",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Beyond great","From the moment we walked through the doors it was a great experience. Each person we dealt with was so friendly and helpful. I only caught the name of one of the staff who helped us check out-Kathrina. She was very kind and efficient. But the girl who helped us check in May 30 around 5pm was beyond great. She booked a shuttle to the airport for the next morning and helped us decide on a restaurant for dinner. The room was perfect. It had some free drinks in the mini fridge and air conditioning and was very quiet. Best hotel we stayed during the entire trip. If I ever make it back to Zurich I will choose this hotel.",6,"2022",5

"Hotel_Alexander","Nice hotel","A very nice central hotel near the train station. We checked in relatively late and were upgraded. Big clean room with one big and one small bed. In room safe and fridge with free drinks (2 beers, 1 coke and 3 waters). The hotel offered a free wifi box that you could carry with you in the whole city, very appreciated. Good breakfast with bacon, egg, bread and much more. Even though Switzerland is quite expensive country even from a Swedish perspective, the room needed to be more inexpensive to get the highest rating. However, we are very happy with our stay.",5,"2022",4
"Hotel_Alexander","A place we'd return to...","We stayed in the Hotel Alexander Guesthouse, a block from the Hotel itself.

The hotel was really good, room was quite small but super clean and modern with a lovely bathroom, good toiletries and a hair dryer. Mini bar stocked with 5 drinks free of charge. Free tea, coffee and water in lobby Breakfast, taken in a small dining room, I expect if the hotel was busy you might need to wait but we had no issues.

We had originally planned for October 2020 but we’re postponed theee times dues to CoVid. Each time, the staff were very understanding. We finally succeeded and had our trip in May 2022. The hotel is not grandiose, but is comfortable and the staff are fabulous. Despite several iterations of our tour, rhe staff happily made changes in numbers, names, and room sizes. The breakfast is good. The staff were able to point me in the direction of good value (and quality) restaurants within walking distance. Thoroughly enjoyable.",5,"2022",5
"Hotel_Alexander","You cannot go wrong at Hotel Alexander","Location, cleanliness, friendly and helpful staff ... Hotel Alexander has it all. The room we stayed in was on the small side but we found it comfortable and efficient. The hotel fronts a busy tourist street full of cafes, bars and restaurants that can be noisy on certain nights. But for the most part, the noise is manageable and not a problem. Getting to the hotel from the central train station by foot is an easy 10-minute walk but only if you exit the station from the front door and not one of the two side doors. Hotel Alexander is the perfect place from which to anchor your stay in Zurich. We'll be back next time we visit Zurich.",5,"2022",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Great small hotel in a center of Zurich","We were staying at a family room - very spacious, clean and nice room. The hotel is located in the middle of shopping and nightlife area of Niederdorf and 50 meters from Limmat river. Our room was very well soundproofed and we didn't suffer from any noise at night. Breakfast was delicious and the staff was very helpful. They also offer a great treat to guests - first fill of the minibar is free (beers, water and coke).

"Hotel_Alexander","With a Location So Close to Everything, How Can You Go Wrong?","This clean and comfortable hotel is right smack in the middle of the old town and is a short, but charming walk on the cobblestone street to anything you desire, whether it's shops, restaurants, the train station, or just plain beautiful scenery. There's even a Starbucks a few steps away! The front desk help, Katharina and Noelle, are as friendly and helpful as can be. Rooms are spartan, but comfortable. Small, but I'm used to that in Europe, unless one wants to pay exorbitant nightly rates. We can afford those rates, but prefer to spend our money on watches, leather goods, and chocolates. The complimentary breakfast is fresh and includes eggs, bacon, German-style sausage, yogurt, cereal for those who wish it, juices, croissants, breads, great coffee, and on and on and",4,"2022",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Great Hotel","Our stay at Alexander Hotel was great, within walking distance to Zurich HB and all central locations in downtown. The hotel is at the entrance if the old city- with lots of restaurants and pubs, wonderful walking around at night. Special atmosphere. The hotel was equipped with everything we needed. Clean, great breakfast, elevator, good heating ( was snowing when we were there). At the reception they gave us good information and even sold 24-48-72 h transportation tickets. Highly recommended!",4,"2022",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Conveniant hotel around the main station","Nicely renovated room with free drinks in minibar. Breakfast was good too. Staff was correct, not overly friendly. Out of convenience I would book there again. It's also close to sights, the old town of Zurich.",4,"2022",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Beautiful hotel, friendly staff, perfect stay","I had an extended stay at the hotel for work and couldn't have had a more comfortable experience. The staff were all incredibly welcoming and accommodating from the very start, when I showed up a couple of hours before check in and they upgraded me into a room that was ready so I could leave my bags and refresh after an overnight flight. Breakfast was included and offered a great selection of hot and cold food, fresh bread, fruit and drinks, including espresso-based coffee. Hope to be back!",3,"2022",5

"Hotel_Alexander","Excellent Hotel! Perfect Location, Lovely Staff, Great Price!","I stayed here for 4 nights and absolutely loved my stay. The first thing I need to mention is that the staff is incredible. They are SO accommodating and helpful. Whether you need to make adjustments to your booking, or want local advice and recommendations, the staff were a delight and extremely helpful. The location can NOT be beat. It's right in the middle of the old town, and trust me - this is where you want to be if you're staying in Zurich. The rooms are very comfortable. The price is very affordable. And finally, the free breakfast was exceptional. I was surprised by this as normally hotels try to keep free breakfasts limited, but not Hotel Alexander. Broad selection of delicious hot/cold food and drink for breakfast. Can't recommend this hotel enough!",3,"2022",5
"Hotel_Alexander","A short tour in Zurich","Good location. There is walking distance to many beautiful sceneries, such as the lake, chruch, and ETH. I can also reach to the SBB train station on foot. However, I can't find disposable slippers, so I have to touch the floor after bathing. 地理位置很好，步行既可到达很多地方，比如湖、教堂、和苏黎世联邦理工大学。步行还可以到达火车站。但是我找不到一次性拖鞋，所以洗完澡后我的脚只能踩在地面上。",3,"2022",4

"Hotel_Alexander","Hotel review","Hotel was perfectly situated for us, as we were wanting to be close to the train station. The included breakfast was delicious, including great breads, cheeses, and egg. Our room was quite small, but worked fine for the one night we were there. However, our room overlooked the walking street, and the noise from the revelers kept us up until 6:00 AM, no kidding! The staff was very accomodating",2,"2022",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Hotel Alexander is a really good city hotel","Me and my colleagues always feel that we are in good hands in this hotel. It is ideal for city trips and for business trips. The hotel is not far from Zurich main station. The hotel rooms are large enough for European hotel rooms, although they are standard, but everything you need is there The hotel only offers breakfast, but there is everything your heart desires, yoghurt, scrambled eggs. For people who don't have a Swiss SIM card, there are free mobile modems for surfing on the go. All in all, a very nice hotel with a good offer",2,"2022",5

"Hotel_Alexander","Centrally located with excellent service","We stayed for 3 weeks in the Hotel Alexander - 10 days while in quarantine because of a positive Covid-19 test. First of all, the location of this establishment is fantastic. It is a short (and I mean short) walking distance to the train station and the Central tram stop. You can take a direct tram to the airport from Central. It is surrounded by quaint shops and their wonderful art gallery as well as other tourist attractions are walking distance too. The staff? Friendly, efficient and knowledgeable. Breakfast is good, but not included. While we were in quarantine, the staff went the extra mile to provide us with everything we need, promptly. This included delivered meals, stationary and printing facilities. Quarantine rules were strictly observed by the hotel and their",1,"2022",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Awesome Hotel!","I have stayed in Zurich several times and on this trip I found the Hotel Alexander after a bit of worthwhile searching. This was the perfect hotel for me! It was an easy walk from the Hauptbahnhof (main train station) even with ski gear and an excellent location in the Altstadt or Old City. Lot's of shops and excellent restaurants surround the hotel. The rooms are very modern (with cool lighting) and spotlessly clean. There is a mini safe in the room as well as a stocked fridge that included water, juices, beer and peanuts & believe it or not, they are all free (unless you request re-stocking). Not many places offer this! The staff were all very friendly, helpful and of course speak English. The beds are very comfortable and there is a large selection of English TV",1,"2022",5

"Hotel_Alexander","Excellent location","This location is perfect for travelers that want to sightsee Zurich. It is only 2 blocks from the train station, around the corner from a tram stop and in the middle of Old Town. Food outside your door as well as shopping. The rooms are small much like most rooms in Europe but comfortable and clean. The only thing that I would change is the toilet paper. It’s like cardboard so bring a roll of your own and you will have a wonderful stay.",11,"2021",5

"Hotel_Alexander","Review of Hotel Alexander","We recently spent two nights in Zurich at the cozy hotel Alexander. We came right from the Zurich Airport and it wasn't a bad walk, considering we had to drag our heavy luggage from the train station. The rooms were typical cozy and European sized. The breakfast was good and very convenient! The gentleman at the front desk was very friendly and helpful, smiling at my attempt to speak Swiss German. LOL! The shower water was nice and hot, perfect after a long and exhausting overnight flight! We recommend the Hotel Alexander!",11,"2021",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Nice, central hotel with great features and staff","This is a great hotel option if you're looking to stay in Zurich. It's only a 2 minute walk (one block) to the Limmat River and about a 10-15 minute walk to the train station. The rooms are pretty small. We had 2 beds in our room and the ceiling was kind of attic-style, with a slant above the beds. There was a tv, a nice sized-closet and an okay-sized bathroom with a shower, toilet and sink. The windows face other buildings, so no great views. The internet was pretty good! We also enjoyed the breakfast options each morning: coffee via an awesome coffee machine, eggs, meats, yogurts, breads, fruits and more. The best part about this hotel was the staff. Super nice and helpful! They helped us mail a postcard to family in the USA. They also gave us directions on which train to",10,"2021",5

"Hotel_Alexander","Disappointed with this Hotel","Hotel Alexander is in a convenient location, in Old Town. Despite the fact it is in an unpleasant block I would say it is the main highlight of the hotel. The room itself is ok, not too small and clean. The problem is that there are important issues with the hotel: - parking: it is about 3 blocks form the hotel and there is a key pick up/drop off process that is not convenient. - noise: there is some kind o streap club just around the corner/ below the hotel. Club music loud all night long. - Wifi: don't count on it. Very weak signal with blind spots in the room. - breakfast: inside the room there is a table with services hours: 7-10:30hs. We arrives about 10:05hs and the breakfast room was closed. Went to reception to complain and the answer was the inside room information was",9,"2021",2

Helpful and pleasant reception staff, perfectly comfortable room (small, but we don't need it any larger), very clean and simply designed. The breakfast is wonderful, much better than I had expected. We'd definitely stay here again.",8,"2021",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Simply Most Convenient Budget Friendly in Zurich","Excellent. It was a short 10 minute walk from the train station. The staff were very helpful and attentive from the moment we arrived at the hotel which was after 8 PM when the reception had closed. We were able to get in with other guests coming in and found a envelope with our name on the desk. It had our room keys and wifi information. The next morning, on completing registration, they included breakfast which I thought was not in our reservation. Also, when we wanted to extend our stay by a day, the staff was extremely accommodating. Overall, very nice hotel, good location and excellent staff. Thank you.",8,"2021",5

"Hotel_Alexander","Wonderful place and wonderful people","We had a grand time staying in Hotel Alexander. The rooms are clean and spacious but the main differentiator are the people. Domini welcomed us at the start of our 5-night stay. The hotel made sure we got everything we needed and more.

A supermarket is just beside the hotel so it was very convenient.",7,"2021",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Great place","Rented this hotel as a day place to store our bags and catch some sleep after a red eye. The receptionist Katarina was very helpful.

Modern place, lots of swissness inside this Hotel. Family run, specially loved the wooden materials used on the floors, reception and the breakfast area. My room faced into the backyard, totally quiet. Its winter time so the tree had no leaves, spring time must have an amazing view. Loved the swiss breakfast with the home made bircher muesli. 7min walking distance from main station, 7min to the lake and its right in the heart of zurich old town.

The cobblestone street is a little hard on rolling luggage, so you may want to stay on Limmatquai, turn on Muhlegasse and backtrack a little toward the hotel. We had a double room with a queen size bed and business singles, also with a queen bed. The double room was spacious. The business single room was nice too, but the large bed left little room to maneuver. The breakfast was very good - good variety and quantity. Wi-fi was excellent. They will lend a mobile wi-fi hotspot which is usable throughout Switzerland. We only used it in Zurich. It was very convenient and saved us the expense of a buying a sim card or paying our own carrier for",1,"2020",5

"Hotel_Alexander","Handy hotel near train station","The Alexander is a comfortable and handy hotel a short walk down the Niederdorf down from the Hauptbahnhof. The rooms are surprisingly large, and the breakfast is good. Friendly staff. I found the decoration a little tired, and somewhat corporate, I would have liked to have seen more paintings/prints. But overall this is a minor criticism. There is a small Migros supermarket right beside the hotel which is very handy.",12,"2019",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Perfect location and service","Hotel is located right in the middle of the old town with plenty of restaurants and bar in the area. Staff went above and beyond in providing services. One night we wanted to have fondue for dinner but we could not find a restaurant that has an availability.

It was easy to get to from the airport as we just took the train and only had to walk 7 minutes from there. Once we arrived, the front desk attendant let us know they had free wi-fi hot spots that we could check out during our stay. The room was small but comfortable and clean. The hotel breakfast was amazing! The best part of the hotel was the location. It was easy to walk to everything from where we were located. Additionally, all of the Christmas markets were up and we walked out the front door and smelled yummy treats! This hotel made our stay and they were nice enough to hold our bags for free on the day we left so that we could explore the city a bit more without carrying luggage. I would definitely recommend",12,"2019",5

Quite challenging to unpack a medium size luggage for 2 pax - The shower area is too small and the shower curtain is not able to cover properly which caused the floor to get wet. Better if using shower screen -",11,"2019",5

The young lady at the reception was very helpful and gave some good tips about city. The room on 4th was good but small. We could see little bit of Limmat river from room. A lot of restaurants, bars and shops were just outside hotel. All the main attractions of Zurich were within walking distance. The breakfast in the morning was quite good with friendly service. Worth staying !!",10,"2019",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Great Location","We found Hotel Alexander to be very convenient to everything we wanted to see/visit on our one-night visit to Zurich. Check-in was quick and easy, and the woman at the front desk was friendly. The room itself is small, but not a big deal to us as we were out and about and really just needed a place to sleep. The room was very clean and comfortable. We didn't experience any noise issues, but our stay was also during the week. We didn't get to experience the included breakfast as our flight was very early. With the excellent location and clean facilities, we'd stay here again on a future visit to Zurich.",10,"2019",5

We loved the convenient location. I can see where it could be noisy if you went to bed early but we don't spend much time in our hotel room. We would definitely stay there again.",9,"2019",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Great service and location","My wife and I enjoyed the convenient location of this hotel. It is very small, yet checks all the boxes. We particularly appreciated the staff who was very helpful and the breakfast was the best in the hotels we visited on our tour of Switzerland.",9,"2019",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Horrible service, bad A/C and noise noise noise","This place is centrally located, which is a plus, but this is also where drunken college kids gather to play Bluetooth speakers, dance and yell (I love that but it’s bad when you want to sleep) and take selfies until around 4:30am. There was no way to sleep here at all and that’s all I really hoped for in a hotel room tbh. The receptionist was super condescending as well and the air conditioning unit didn’t work at all. In short, my wife and I didn’t sleep at all that night (don’t book here on a weekend).",9,"2019",2
"Hotel_Alexander","Fantastic stay - highly recommend","I stayed here for 3 nights. The location is perfect, very central to everything. There is a great variety of food on offer in the immediate vicinity. They even provided me with a complimentary pocket wifi device so that I could use Google maps when wandering this picturesque city. I would definitely stay here again.",9,"2019",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Fantastic stay","The hotel is perfectly located just a few minutes away from the central station and in the heart of the old city. The staff is very friendly and helpul. I would come back. Rooms are modern and very confortable.",9,"2019",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Very accommodating","No problem with street noise, we loved the location, close to everything. Breakfast excellent. Rooms a bit small but clean and renovated. Air conditioning could have been a bit better. Gave a great recommendation on a Chinese restaurant nearby. Would definitely come back.",9,"2019",4

Everything you need and more!! I have nothing negative to stay. I am a very picky person with hotels and this in my opinion was a 10/10. Recommend to anyone.",9,"2019",5
"Hotel_Alexander","25th Wedding Anniv in Switzerland","This hotel is wonderful! The room was nice and clean and new! The staff is marvelous! Laura at the front desk was the most helpful ever! And Arturo helped park and fetch our car whenever we asked. Looked for places for us to eat and also things to do for our next visit! Just the most special people ever! The breakfast was to die for and the lady working there was fantastic! I can't say enough about this hotel and staff! We are so blessed to have stayed there! Centrally located to so many good restaurants and things to do! Stay there if you get the chance!",9,"2019",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Pleasurable stay","After being let down by another hotel, we decided on the Alexander for our stay. Let's say we were very happy that we changed. The rooms are spacious, clean and modern. Staff are very helpful and friendly, with a special mention to Rina for all her help. Great idea with the WiFi hotspot. All in all would definitely recommend and if we come back for future Diamond League finals will happily stay again.",8,"2019",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Clean, friendly place in old town","Proceed reasonably, the staff were friendly and provided needed information. You get a free wireless device for internet access that you can borrow sitting your stay. The hotel is accessible from the train station and is walkable to the street where you can walk along the water. We took the rooms at the end of the hotel as there was a music festival at night and we could not hear anything in our room. Breakfast was the usual selection as well. We stayed here for a night after our flight before moving on to the Swiss mountain areas. There were a number of restaurants in walkable distance in the area.",8,"2019",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Very good","Great location. We had a family room which was a good size for the 3 of us. Had everything we needed. Very clean and the air conditioning was very efficient. The door to the bathroom is opaque so with the light on you can see outlines etc. Some people may not like that. The breakfast is buffet style and we were very happy with it. The pastries were tasty and the food was kept topped up. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Umbrellas are available if you need them, there are limited WiFi bots available (first come first served) as well as electric scooters - again limited availability. We reserved a space in the garage which is interesting. You drive your car into a lift to go down to the underground car park. It is tight so check the size of your car before you reserve",8,"2019",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Perfect location price and stay","Just the right location for getting to my clients. Also for the surrounding ambiance in the evening for dinner.

"Hotel_Alexander","Very convenient location and loads of restaurants and shops nearby!","We just returned from a European vacation, ending with a three night stay in Hotel Alexander! It was just what we were looking for as far as convenience to train station, trams, shops, and restaurants. The breakfast was just perfect, the room was air-conditioned and quiet, and had the amenities we needed for a brief stay. My husband frequented the Italian gelato shop next door every day. There is a Migros store very close, too, where we bought Swiss chocolate, and a few souvenirs. Friendly, helpful staff! We couldn’t have been more pleased.",8,"2019",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Outstanding Stay.","Hotel is really conveniently located.5 mins walk from the Central tram station,10 mins walk to the main Zurich station.Loads of restaurants,bars and grocery stores closeby. Rooms though a bit small are well planned and totally functional, main feature being air conditioning which is not available in majority of the properties.Breakfast was good too. The front desk staff were amongst the most helpful,accommodating and friendliest we have come across in our travels. They gave us an early check in after knowing that my wife was expecting was a truly wonderful gesture. We highly recommend this property,travellers booking this place will not go wrong at all.",8,"2019",5
"Hotel_Alexander","In the heart of Altstadt Zurich","This hotel is small but has nice clean rooms in the heart of Altstadt Zurich. Not on the inexpensive side of hotels the rooms are small but modern and clean. The staff are super friendly and helpful. Ask about the free mobile hotspot they have at no extra cost. This was a great service and saved us having to buy SIM cards that work in Switzerland. I would stay here again. It was lovely to walk out the door straight into restaurants and shopping. Just one block back from the river and close to everything that Altstadt and the City core has to offer.",8,"2019",4
"Hotel_Alexander","A good find!","Had a good one night stay at Hotel Alexander on my last night in Switzerland. The hotel is an easy 10-12 min walk from the train station on a street filled with restaurants in all price categories. I was given a very friendly welcome at the hotel and much enjoyed a room with air conditioning (not a given in Switzerland, but necessary when the temperature outside is 38C). Breakfast at the hotel was average. The hotel is clean, though I encountered one problem with the room, finding a used water bottle and some scraps of paper under the bed. When reported, the staff was horrified and ran to the room to rectify the problem immediately. That is good care of guests! Despite this little hiccup I would definitely return to the hotel if in Zurich again.",8,"2019",5

"Hotel_Alexander","Great Little Hotel","We spent two nights in the Hotel Alexander on our way to and from Wengen. We totally loved the location on a little cobblestoned street lined with sidewalk restaurant tables and small shops. The staff was extremely helpful with all our arrangements and the rooms were very comfortable: nice beds and great little showers. It does have a lift if that is a concern to you. And at least some of the rooms are air conditioned. We were there on one extremely hot night and were able to sleep comfortably. Even though my room faced the street, there was almost no noise at night and the blackout blinds are excellent. The breakfast is included and was delicious. It is an easy walk to and from the Main Train Station, even with suitcases, which makes it a perfect base for sight seeing and",7,"2019",5

"Hotel_Alexander","Super WOW!!","Hotel booking around the time of Zurich s big fest every three years was not easy. BUT, We found Alexander Hotel to our delight. There are many good things about Hotel Alexander: 1. Excellent location. It is conveniently located amidst shops and restaurants. Walking distance to the main station and a block away from the river. 2. Room is very clean. Beds are comfortable. Beddings are changed daily. There's a minimal refrigerator and a safe. Space to hang up clothes is small but adequate. 3. Continental breakfast is simple but enough. 4. Parking is available nearby. 5. Excellent pleasant efficient staff. Shout out especially to Luigi!! He is THE BEST!!! Although this hotel is small, the service surpasses many 5 or 4 star hotels. We thoroughly enjoyed staying at",7,"2019",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Good Location and free traveling hotspot were fantastic","We stayed here the Wednesday and Thursday before Easter. The location was fantastic-an easy walk to the train station and a nice walk to the river and up to the lake, where there was a farmers market in progress. The Niederorfstrasse was nice as it was pedestrian only and there were many nice shops and restaurants in the area. The hotel breakfast was also first rate. Another nice service is a free wifi hotspot that you can take with you as you walk around the city. The staff was friendly and offered good suggestions and even tolerated my attempts at elementary German with a smile. The only warning I would make is that there is a definite club scene on the Niederdorfstrasse at night which goes well into the early morning hours. If you like to sleep with your windows open to",7,"2019",5

"Hotel_Alexander","Fantastic hotel with exceptional service!","I was thrilled with my stay at the Hotel Alexander. The location is perfect - it’s in the heart of the old town by the river with lots of great restaurants and bars around. The lake is also a short walk away. The room was very clean and comfortable, and the breakfast was tasty. The thing that stood out to me most was the service. All of the staff went above and beyond to make sure my stay was comfortable. Luigi in particular went out of his way to help me out. I highly recommend this hotel, I would definitely stay there again!",7,"2019",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Excellent location for a good price","The hotel is right at the doorstep of the pedestrian street with all the restaurants, so an excellent location. Close to a tram stop so public transport is easy and within walking distance to the main train station. Although the hotel is small, the rooms are compact but functional and comfortable. Rooms are clean and bedding is comfortable. Reception are very helpful and friendly and the breakfasts are not expansive but give a reasonable variety of choices for a buffet style breakfast. Moderately priced hotel and well worth considering.",7,"2019",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Great location, breakfast and service","The location is fantastic, 5 blocks from the train station and right in the canter of the old town. You can walk everywhere. The rooms are not big but confortable and great air conditioning. Our room in the 2nd floor was ideal since the breakfast room is on the same floor. The beakfast selection was good and they bring the coffee to your table therefore you don't have to make a line. Plenty of restaurants are next to the hotel including an inexpensive pizza, pasta and ice cream shop next door. On the other side is also a fine restaurant with good food (Alexis). The hotel is on a pedestrian only street one block from the river promenade, All of the reception and service personnel were great and attentive. Check in was very quick and efficient. One of the receptionist,",7,"2019",5

And there are many bars in the area also",7,"2019",5

The directions from the website were very easy to follow. The hotel is a small boutique hotel in the heart of old town. Despite being in the old town, it was actually quiet at night and were able to sleep comfortably. The breakfast was also very good. You can walk to the new town across the bridge in a few minutes. The lake is 10 minutes away. There is so much to do and explore within walking distance from this hotel. The room was clean and was a good size. They leave Toberlone on your pillow! Such a nice welcome to Zurich. No complaints. Free Wifi. Front desk was incredibly helpful. One of our travels needed some medication and the front desk directed us to a small",6,"2019",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Historic hotel, in the heart of old Zurich","We arrived too early to access our room, but they were happy to store our bags while we went out to wander. When we came back they had the room ready. This is a standard room, set up for twin beds with a double and single so they met my request. There is also a shower which I had requested. The room is not overlarge but big enough, being on the 4th floor the window is in a sort of gable. The double bed is pushed against one wall, but there is a desk/ ledge/ computer desk running the full length of the room under the window. It is all quite light and airy. Like most other hotels in Switzerland the room is a little warm for our liking but with a window open it is satisfactory. Breakfast is continental and no different to all other breakfasts we have had in Switzerland,",6,"2019",4

"Hotel_Alexander","Affordable accommodation","Hotel Alexander is a cosy hotel in walking distance from the main station and Bauernschänke. The rooms are clean but on the smaller side. There are the usual amenities however you will need to ask for a kettle if you require. There are many food outlets in front of the hotel. Ironically enough you cannot hear the noise from inside the room. Overall I would recommend staying in this hotel. Also call out to Laura at reception. She is very accommodating to us and other customers that we observed.",6,"2019",4

The hotel was spotlessly clean and a great location for food and other shopping requirements as well as as close to services. Highly recommended 😊",5,"2019",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Fantastic Service","This hotel is perfectly situated in the centre of town, with easy access to all amenities. The Main Station is almost opposite; just a stone’s throw away. The rooms are compact, but very clean and well-equipped. However, best of all are the staff, for which nothing is too much trouble. I had brought the wrong electrical adapter - a replacement was found straight away. We were late for breakfast - a special effort was made to fetch us fresh coffee and tea.

"Hotel_Alexander","Good Value and Location","My husband and I stayed here for two evenings en route back to the US. Since we were traveling into Zurich via train fairly late in the evening, location was the ultimate deciding factor. For that, you cannot go wrong here. Centrally located to shops, good restaurants, and the lake, everything is accessible within walking distance. While the rooms are on the small side, it is not unusual for the older/central part of town. However, the rooms were clean, well appointed, and has all the essentials you may possibly need. The front desk staff was also attentive and made great restaurant recommendations. They also offered complimentary WiFi hotspots which turned out to be super helpful as we explored the city.

The Hotel is located in the old-town, and it is very easy to get around from there. There are lots of shops and dining options in the area, certainly plenty to explore - or a short walk to cross the river to Bahnhofstrasse, Zurich’s main shopping area (notable for more watch shops than I thought possible to jam into one place). On a whim I took the quick ride on the Polybahn funicular not far from the hotel. This was well worth it as when you get out at the top as there are some great views of the city skyline.",2,"2019",4

There is a bar Alex joined onto it where you can get food & drinks, I didn't use it as I wasn't sure what was nearby or if things would be open as my plane was delayed and it was late evening so I grabbed a MacDonald's on the way from the station - a pity really as there are lots of restaurants and drinking options nearby - overall its in a great location, 5 minutes from the station. One review said it had great breakfasts - it was continental Germanic style, not my cup of tea really so I just grabbed a croissant and orange juice which were nice. Then I discovered the scrambled eggs and the electric toaster. What a",12,"2018",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Convenient","My husband and I feel spoiled after staying here for several nights! The hotel was about a 10 minute walk from the train station, and a 15 minute walk from the lake. There was even a little Christmas market right outside the hotel. We were able to borrow a wifi hot spot, which allowed us to use wifi as we walked around Zurich (and the zoo).",12,"2018",5

"Hotel_Alexander","Nice Hotel, Great Location","What a great location for a very nice hotel. Loved staying in the heart of Old Town with restaurants, shoppes and the Christmas Markets literally right outside your door. This is a small hotel with I think less than 30 rooms. Elevator makes it painless with baggage to get to your room. Small fridge and room safe provided. The rooms are recently redone and every detail of the room was refurbished to a very nice standard. Room was impeccably clean on arrival. Staff was very helpful on arrival. Only downside is the rooms are pretty small, I have stayed at Sheraton, Mariott, SwissHotel Oerlikon which all have larger rooms-but are a bit away from the city center. I am loving being right in the center of town with Hotel Alexander and the smaller room is just fine! Sleep",11,"2018",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Lovely hotel in an old town setting","Alexander guesthouse was in the old town in a central location. The room was comfortable enough, the bed was perhaps a little too soft for my husband who suffers with his back.However they allowed us to upgrade for a small fee to the Alexander hotel.Our room there was really lovely overlooking the old town. The bed was firm and very comfortable. Breakfast was lovely,hot and cold choices and nice coffee. All of the staff were friendly and helpful. One of the ladies working at reception went out of her way to help me move our bags to our upgraded room.",11,"2018",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Great stay","I stayed in a twin room with a friend for 2 nights. From the minute we arrived we felt very comfortable. Check in was quick and friendly. Reception staff were very helpful. The room was a good size and clean. There was a free safe and a good bathroom with a nice powerful shower. the location was ideal, in the middle of the old town and only a short walk to the station and city. Breakfast was great, a good choice. The ladies were very friendly and accommodating. Beds were comfortable, only criticism from me was the glass door to the bathroom, I woke up every time my friend went to the toilet and turned the light on. We arrived before 11am and our room was ready which was great and after checking out we left our luggage in the reception area. We will definitely be back.",11,"2018",5

Absolutely recommend.",11,"2018",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Expensive for Basics","Generally not impressed. Pros: Nice staff. Decent breakfast. Good location. Cons: expensive , tiny space, room and sheets smelled like body odor, bathroom smelled like sewage, no lotion or amenities. They have this “best rate guarantee” which is very misleading and was one of the reasons I booked with them. When we arrived we noticed the rates were significantly cheaper and I inquired about the best rate “GUARANTEE”... “oh yes sir, that’s a guarantee for the exact time you book it , that no other site has a lower price, that guarantee expires the next day”. What a scam! There are better options for a fraction of the price all around.",11,"2018",2
"Hotel_Alexander","Absolutely Recommend!","We checked into Hotel Alexander in the early hours of the weekend, the staff here are very professional, friendly, helpful & welcoming! We were checked in efficiently and the hotel is clean, modern & contemporary designed. It runs on a 24/7 basis, so you can check in & out at any time. Our room was to a high standard, clean and smart. We were pleased to find chocolates, a sufficient amount of tea/coffee facilities too. Our stay also came with a free breakfast each morning, this offered a nice range of options & was sufficient to start each day. Would certainly stay here again, thank you Hotel Alexander!",11,"2018",5
"Hotel_Alexander","The first night in Europe","This was our first night in Europe. Parking is not far, but the bellhop has to go with you to show the way. It was my first time using an elevator for the car to access underground parking. It cost 30 CF per night. After checking in we were able to park the car, we were able to easily walk to all of the sights of downtown. Location was awesome! The staff was very nice, friendly and helpful. The room was quite small, no room to even walk around with our suitcases in the room. It was very noisy until late at night, as our room was over the street with bars and restaurants. This happened to also be the most expensive hotel of our 11 nights around Switzerland, Austria and Italy",10,"2018",4

"Hotel_Alexander","Lovely welcoming staff, sweet little hotel, centrally placed","This is quirky little place, quite hard to find by car, and even harder to then park in the underground car park for the astonishing price of 34 CHF per night, but with the help of the delightful Arthur, we managed it! What an absolutely lovely man, so helpful, and with good English, although I can speak German. In fact, all the staff were adorable, in particular Katerina on the desk as we arrived, and Rina Roll on the day we left. I can't praise them all enough for their helpfulness, their welcome and their general cheerfulness and willingness to make our stay pleasant and enjoyable. Our room was in the corner, overlooking part of the old town, surrounded by bars and restaurants, but surprisingly quiet, due to the excellent double glazing, However, the air conditioning was",10,"2018",4

"Hotel_Alexander","Quaint But Noisy","Ask for a room on a higher floor. Our room on first floor had a lot of street noise from restaurants and bars until 2:00. This was our final night In Switzerland. We got no sleep and left for airport at 4:45. However, the night manager kindly offered us coffee and croissants to take with us. We had stayed here 8 days earlier at the beginning of our trip and had a room on the third floor which was quiet and we had a pleasant stay. It is fun to be in Niederdorfstrasse, easy walk with bags to train station and a good breakfast is served. Be aware that rooms are small.",9,"2018",4
"Hotel_Alexander","In the spot.","Perfect little hotel right in amongst lots of little restaurants and bars. Check in, from the beginning was welcoming with smiles and info on our stay in hotel and Zurich. room very clean with double glazing to shut out noise and also an exterior blind for extra quiet. Bed firm and wide. Although room not large was adequate for our three night stay in beautiful Zurich. Breakfast good. Overall staff wonderful. Sunday's, shops in Zurich shut but restaurants open. Railway shops are open.",9,"2018",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Great location, very accommodating","Comfortable room. Very accommodating after an overnight, exhausting flight. Were able to leave bags and prepared our room early and let us know when to expect it ready. Small extra fee for secured paring nearby. Nice breakfast. Our 4yo daughter loved the bowl if of fresh apples at the fruit front every morning! Only a block or so from the river, easily walkable to everywhere including lake and central train station.",9,"2018",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Delicious breakfast especially if you love BACON!","I got the hotel's name from Rick Steve's book and yet again he doesn't disappoint. The room and bathroom were clean smelled fresh. The noise outside was fairly well blocked. I could have lowered the roll down shutters and it would have blocked the noise but it was nice to be in the thick of things. Anyway they do provide paid parking but its offsite just a quick walk around the corner. I will stay gere again.",9,"2018",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Great Stay","This was the best hotel I stayed in on a month long trip through Europe. It was clean, comfortable and central, and the staff were friendly.

I had lots of questions and they had all the answers.",8,"2018",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Excellent Hotel","I booked this hotel based on other reviews and the location and I was not disappointed. Our room was one the small rooms with a queen sized bed. Even though it was small, it was efficiently designed. A little desk, a closet, safe, refrigerator with complementary water bottles, small shower, but great pressure (!). There was plenty of good lighting and outlets to charge our various electronics. I did not need anymore room. The breakfast was wonderful. Great coffee, eggs, bacon, all sorts of meats and cheeses, cereal, juices, bread (lots of variety), pastries, etc. Staff was very friendly. My husband was traveling with a bicycle and they offered to store it downstairs. The location was great. It’s a short walk to the train station... we wheeled the bike in its bike case",8,"2018",5

Its in the heart of fashionable Old Town,in a cobbled pedestrianisation a stones throw away from River. It hums with cafes and restaurants serving up typical Swiss dishes such as raclette, fondue and schnitzel. Recently modernised I found my room really comfortable complete with air con and separate loo and shower, plenty of room for this solo traveller. Excellent choice of breakfast buffet on offer, including gluten free bread. I don't like lots of noise, but found the room quiet especially considering it's situation.

"Hotel_Alexander","Wonderful Hotel","We stayed two nights in this gem of a hotel. The hotel staff could not have been friendlier and helpful. The rooms are spotless and comfortable. The breakfast room was cherry and presented a nice breakfast. The location is near the rail station lined with restaurants and shops. It is a short walk to the river and main shopping district and tourist sites. My only advice would be to ask for a room not facing the street due to noise. Compared to other hotels we stayed in this hotel is a very good value.",8,"2018",5
"Hotel_Alexander","perfect stay in Zürich","Excellent location, wonderful staff. Clean and cool. Best breakfast I ever had in Switzerland.

Absolutely recommended.",8,"2018",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Great small hotel","This hotel is in the old town amongst all the restaurants. Very clean with exceptional good staff who nothing you ask them is any trouble. The rooms are small as most are in Europe but not small enough to be annoying. Reasonably priced for a very expensive city. It was very hot while we were there and we were unfortunate to have one of the rooms without air conditioning. The fan helped a little. Overall I would certainly book this hotel again.",8,"2018",4

The Restaurant’s in the area their foods look amazing, we could tell as we strolled looking for a nice place to spend our last night eating in Switzerland. We were not disappointed with hour choice of hotel. TA writers do a great job describing the places. This is why we opted for this hotel It’s centrally located to the train station which is a must if you are going to use Switzerland’s amazing transportation system. I don’t think any other country in the world compares to this extraordinary rail system! The staff is wonderful and kind. The price is equitable to location and service. Don’t hesitate booking this hotel. It’s a real good deal.",8,"2018",5

Short pretty walk across the river to the tram and train stations, and new town area. Our room was on the top floor and was spotlessly clean and very quiet. We appreciated the efficient air conditioning and the shutters for keeping the room dark for sleep. The staff were incredibly helpful when booking, in the run up to our trip, and during our stay. Highly recommend for an Ironman Switzerland stay. The owners are triathletes themselves and gave us the option of storing our bike in our room or in their secure bike garage where they store their bikes.

"Hotel_Alexander","Great Central Hotel","We are just back from a 3 night break. We picked the hotel for the location which did not disappoint.... it is central in the old town on a pedestrian cobbled street with many bars and restaurants at your doorstep. We paid extra for the larger room with air con which was beneficial as the weather was over 34 degrees. The staff were very helpful and the breakfast excellent. I would certainly recommend.",7,"2018",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Nice hotel","Booked this hotel through online. The place is 7-10 mins walk from the train station. It is located in a small road though. Surrounding the hotel are restaurants and pubs. But its not that noisy or scary place. Though i booked for an air conditioned room; when i checked in they gave me a room with just an electric fan. Paid the same price. During day time, its a little bit warm but on nightime, i opened 1 window for a better ventilation. The staff were good. Breakfast, only few choices but just enough though. Seems newly renovated. The room was clean and the toilet and bathroom are spotless clean.",7,"2018",4

"Hotel_Alexander","Handy spot to explore Zurich and beyond","Hotel Alexander is an easy walk from the main Zurich train station if you don't mind dragging your suitcase down city streets. (Not so bad , really) Lots of resturants close by. The breakfast in the hotel is great with a friendly staff who give you a happy ""Morgan!"" when you walk in. Rooms comfortable good ammmenities. Just a short one block from the river that leads you to the whole city. Hotel is in what is referred to as ""The Redlight"" district. Never fear as the strip clubs fronts are not obnoxious and it a cool part of the whole old town experience. HAve stayed there 3 time and will again.",6,"2018",4

"Hotel_Alexander","Great location","My daughter and I stayed here March 23-26. It was a perfect location, close to the train station, restaurants and shops all over and it is on a cute street. Our room was a corner room with windows on both sides, very bright and cheery. Every morning breakfast was delicious. Anna runs the kitchen and is delightful! It was nothing extravagant but just what we needed. My daughter is gluten free and there was eggs 2 different ways as well as yogurt and fruit. For the price I would recommend this hotel!",4,"2018",5

"Hotel_Alexander","Good city hotel","We spent a night at this hotel in Zurich. It is located very centrally in the busy Niederdorf quarter, in Walking distance to the main train station and Zurich Downtown. We were glad they had a separate underground garage for our car, since parking space in Zurich is non-existent or terribly expensive. The rooms are clean, though very small. Our room did face to a small side-alley, where some loud unloading operation took place at 6 am on a Saturday. The breakfast buffet is very nice and thorough. All employees were very friendly. All in all, it was good value for money.",3,"2018",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Best 3* ever visited.","In the old town of the city, Alexander Hotel is perfect. First it is very close to train station, second it is located in the heart of the town where you can access everywhere by walk, third and the most important issue for me is that the rooms are newly refurbished, because in an old town like Zurich, usually all the 3* hotels need a renovation. The staff is very polite and our rooms were ready at 11 o'clock even the usual check in time is at 14:00. The coffee machine at the entrance is a very good surprise. My room was a standard single one with a large king size & most comfy bed. The bathroom was small but new!!! Even the hotel is located on the main street, the windows are sound proof so I could sleep easily. The breakfast is typical with limited choice but good quality. To",3,"2018",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Hotel Alexander where you don't need to lock your door!","A seemingly nice hotel with nice rooms and good breakfast. In my view the concept of having a lock is so one can lock your door. Obviously for safety reasons, and mostly to feel safe at night, and to protect your belongings without have to worry about easy access to your stuff. When complaining at the front desk ,the reception brushes our complaints off, stating this is a safe neighborhood. In fact she seemed offended we suggested we wanted a working lock. She even suggested she would get a technician to look at it in the morning (which isn't really helpful when you check out the next morning). So the night was mostly sleepless worrying about the door. Still, a nice hotel but the service this night was something of the worst I've experienced. Please: next time, offer",2,"2018",3
"Hotel_Alexander","Two thumbs up","This is a great hotel, I have no complaints. Lovely room, attentive staff. I have no complaints. This was my first time in Zurich and it was great to be right smack in the middle of the city. The neighborhood is older and has a lot of history and older buildings and architecture, which is great for history lovers like myself. I would definitely stay at this hotel again.",1,"2018",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Great small hotel","Staff couldn't be more helpful. Given an upgrade as double booked. In a triple room on the top floor. Plenty of room for two people. Great location about 5mins from the train station. Zurich is not a large city. Easily walkable in a few hours. Christmas markets mainly food by the opera House. Zurich card not bought as walkable and most museums are free 😊 Check opening hours as alot of places closed on a Sunday. German not French the main language in Zurich.",12,"2017",5

There are sofas in the lobby so my elderlies can rest while we did the check in. Rooms - We had a triple room and a twin room. Both rooms are near the lift. Convenient for my elderlies. The triple room - The triple room is a corner room. It has two windows (one facing the side alley and one facing the dining/shopping alley) so it is bright even without switching on the lights.

We picked this hotel based on location as well as good reviews from others. The hotel is located on a fairly lively street a block from the river. There are a plenty of restaurants and shops nearby. The streetcar stop is also nearby. I would not consider this to be one of the luxury hotels, but it was a very nice mid-range option. Check in was very efficient. Our room was clean and functional, though rather small (standard size for Europe, I'm afraid). Location was excellent.",11,"2017",4

"Hotel_Alexander","Feeling of being deceived! (Updated on 10/21/2017)","In August 2017, I stayed in Hotel Alexander for 2 nights. In Beginning, right after I stepped into the hotel, I was asked to pay my stay in full in U.S. dollars although I booked with a valid credit card. When I insisted on paying in local money to avoid 3.5% currency conversion fee, the receptionist kept asking “are you sure??” even though she knew the trick well. (Trick 1: mislead and thus cheat on currency conversion fee) Then, I was given a 2nd floor room without A.C. despite my booking reservation clearly stated my room was equipped with A.C. When I asked to change the room, the receptionist said there was no room with A.C. available on that day. And the only thing she could do was to give me an extra fan.

We stayed in Hotel Alexander on the way down south to Zermatt. Pro: - Nice and clean hotel - Good location - Ok breakfast - Good value for money Negatives: - Rooms were a little cramped - The place was extremely hot with no air conditioning. We slept with the windows wide open due to the hot stuffy room, which meant we could hear noise from the main road as well pubs & hotels close by. - Free wi-fi was a bit slow - Soft pillows Overall nice hotel back the lack of a fan/cooling options meant our night sleep was not the best.",10,"2017",3
"Hotel_Alexander","very small rooms","Our hotel of choice was booked for our dates so they suggested the Hotel Alexander. We found the rooms extremely small, approximately 8' by 8'. The receptionist talked us into paying in US$ which was a big mistake as the hotel receipt say there is a 3.50% markup included in the exchange rate. We tried to void the transaction within 15 minutes but were told by the receptionist that it was too late. Overall we felt we were being taking advantage of at this hotel.",10,"2017",2

I recommend the scrambled eggs.",10,"2017",1

I chose this hotel because it met my simple needs (bed, central location, TV, free WiFi, and bathroom). I was not disappointed. The hotel and room were clean and quiet, the hotel staff was courteous, Alexander is centrally located, and the free breakfast was fantastic! My favorite thing about the hotel was that they put an apple in the room and there was a bowl of apples on the front desk - I don't know if this is standard year round or just because it's autumn, but I loved it!

"Hotel_Alexander","Average!","We stayed at hotel alexander as a family for a whole week in august. The room we got was small. even below the average size, that a hotel room can be, but can’t blame the hotel as all the rooms they had were small and they didn’t know we are going to stay with a kid as our travel agent hasn’t communicated well. The bathroom was big enough comparing to the room. For the price we paid, the room didn’t provide many essential amenities. There wasn’t a tea/coffee maker. But you can request for a kettle if you want. We got a complimentary water bottle only upon our arrival but that was it. Water was never been refilled. The bed was comfortable enough but the pillows were a torture! They were very huge but very flat and uncomfortable. We travelled during a very hot time in the year",9,"2017",3

Closed to the hotel are 2 bridges which can take you across the river to Bahnhofstrasse, the main shopping street of Zurich City. The Beyer Clock & Watch Museum is located on this street.

The hotel is located within the old city, and close to many attractions and restaurants. The train station, Zurich HB, is also nearby, making the hotel a convenient base from which to explore Zurich.

That is where we picked up our 3 full day tours. The room was a little small and because it has a modern motif, storage space is a little difficult. Staff were friendly and helpful. The pillows were a little oversized but went flat. Not very comfortable. Breakfast was served with freshly scrambled eggs and lots of cold cuts, sufficient fruit. The coffee was very good. Wake up calls were delivered as requested. The shower had good pressure. I would not hesitate to recommend to anyone.

"Hotel_Alexander","Great location","Hotel Alexander was a great stay. I was only spending one night here to catch a plane the next morning. The staff was friendly and helped sort out an issue I had when making reservations. The room was small since I was a solo traveler (fine for my purposes). It had a nice modern touch to it, breakfast and wifi were included as well. The hotel is located along a huge strip of restaurants, cafes, and bars. Despite the activity around it, I did not hear much from the fourth floor. The location also puts you dead smack in old town and minutes walk from all the landmarks and train station.

Hanging space is somewhat limited with no wardrobe as such available in my single room. Over-riding any minor inconveniences is the hotel's superb location. Most tourist attractions on both sides of the river are within walking distance. I was particularly impressed by the very helpful multi-lingual reception staff. A basket of fruit, coffee, water and of course Swiss chocolates are available for the taking at the reception desk. As with most other things in Switzerland, the tariff of around CHF 250 (AUD 350 per night) is ""not cheap"" but typical.",5,"2017",4

The hotel is very centrally located to the train station (5 minute walk) and in the old city , located near all the attractions of that part of town. The room also included a continental breakfast that had a great, fresh selection of foods. As the hotel is very centrally located, it is also near many restaurants and bars and with the windows closed we still heard people outside in the middle of the night.

The Zurich rail station, and central stop etc are at walking distance. If there were a small table and two chairs in the room it would have been great. Over all I loved the stay at hotel for its location, cleanliness and friendly staff.",4,"2017",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Nice location!","Nice hotel if you need to be in the centre of Zurich: close to the Central Station and in the middle of the old town. Lots of restaurants, pubs, etc on walking distance. Good quality...not cheap, but Switzerland is rather expensive for tourists. Good breakfast.",4,"2017",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Zurich Marathon vacation","We stayed at Hotel Alexander for the marathon this year because of the reviews we found on TripAdvisor. I have to say that we were not disappointed! The hotel is easy to find, just a short walk from the main train station even with luggage and a stroller it took approx 10 mins! Located on Niederdorf there are restaurants and activities everywhere! And the apples the hotel provides for the guests are the best to be found! The room we stayed in was clean and large enough for our needs and did I mention the apples! Would definitely recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Zurich!",4,"2017",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Comfortable, clean, great location!","Hotel was in a fantastic location. Several blocks of shops, pubs, cafes and restaurants. The room was quiet and comfortable. The main shopping street is located just across the river and up a few blocks, right by the train station. A reasonable price for the location. Would stay again!",4,"2017",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Little Gem big personality","Perfect location for us, we like to be in the hub of everything, lots of restaurants and very good ones, lots of bars and we also found a nice little club to dance the night away. Everywhere in a few minutes walk, day and night. Lovely to walk along the lake in the sunshine. It was perfect for us. If your going to moan about noise in the evening then go and stay somewhere quieter but don't leave negative feedback for this little hotel, it's not their fault they are in such a great location. If you want a massive room then pay more and stay somewhere else the room was adequate size and immaculately clean.",4,"2017",5

The rooms at the hotel are clean and comfortable and there is a variety of options on the breakfast menu. There is a choice of small eating places close by , the best being a fondue restaurant right on the hotel doorstep .

And right in the middle of everything: restaurants, bars the main railway station. An excellent choice",2,"2017",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Great location and friendly staff!","My wife and I stayed over for a few days in Zurich and arrived by train at the main train station. The hotel is easy enough to find as it is just down the cobblestone street. Pulling luggage down the street is noisy and a little challenging. What I liked about our stay were: 1. The reception was very friendly and helpful, recommending places to go, and a good fondue place down the road. 2. The room was not too small, enough room for 2 of us to move around unhindered. 3. Room and bathroom were clean, heating was on throughout the day (which I loved). 4. Breakfast provided had a generous selection of cooked food, cold cuts, pastries and coffee and tea came as personal little pots, which I found lovely. 5.

"Hotel_Alexander","Wonderful stay","The location was perfect, the price was a good deal, the room was comfortable, and the staff were friendly and efficient.

"Hotel_Alexander","A home away from home","I spent almost a week at the Alexander and loved it. The staff were always very warm, welcoming and helpful. It was impeccably clean and the room had everything I needed for a comfortable stay.

The breakfast is fine for a 3 star hotel. Booked last minute it was a bit pricey but so is all of Zurich!",12,"2016",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Ideally Situated","My wife and I stayed three nights at the Alexander and found the staff very helpful and accomodating, the location ideal, and the room comfortable though compact. The breakfasts were part of the room charge and had a nice selection of meal choices. Given that Zurich is quite expensive the breakfasts add real value to staying there. If there are events in the old town such as Fasnacht which took place while we were there, the hotel in right in the middle of the event. The room also had a safe. A very good place to stay.",11,"2016",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Small clean hotel, in a great location!","After reading the trip advisor reviews i decided to book a twin room at this hotel. To be honest it's exactly as it says on the tin. It's in a great location in the old town. The tourist points in Zurich are so accessible by foot. With tram 3 stopping at the top of the street and tram 4 running along the riverside. The hotel is a earshot away from an excellent choice of bars and restaurants that can be explored in thecsurrounding quaint cobbled streets! A bonus is there is a mini Mart and an off licence on the corner of the street. Which helps as the only thing in the mini bar is two complimentry bottled waters and two apples in the room. Very healthy 😣 There is a takeaway Italian and wine bar next door to the hotel, with a couple of restaurants on the door step. The",11,"2016",4

"Hotel_Alexander","Very late seeking desparate for accommodation. Great Hotel and night staff","We have lost our key to the apartment we rented in Zurich for one week while on vacation . We had to look for alternative accommodation at 21:30 at night. However all our personal belongings - Proof of identity, passports and credit cards were locked in the apartment. Only one room was available at the hotel and the night staff was so friendly to accommodate us while taking only our word that we would only be able to pay for our stay the next afternoon at 16:00 when the owner of the apartment will return to Zurich with the duplicate apartment key. Hotel is near to many of the attractions Zurich has to offer.",11,"2016",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Quaint Old Town Stay","Hotel was selected for location near Hirschenplatz and to have a cobblestone alley ambiance. Stayed in room 309 which overlooked a courtyard garden. Rooms are very clean and nicely appointed contemporary designs although not very large. Air circulation was by window only so if traveling during hot periods, it may get quite warm. Breakfast was suitable for a good start to the day and reception staff was very helpful. elevator is quite small so large luggage would occupy space of another traveler. About 8 min walk to train station. Stay was 6/12-6/14.",11,"2016",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Great Location in the middle of old town.","The location is Great! You can just step out of the hotel and start walking down Niederdorfstrasse. Great pasta place right next door.

"Hotel_Alexander","lovely hotel in the heart of the old town","I stayed here for a couple of nights recently. The hotel is an easy 5-10 minute walk from the station in the heart of the old town. On arrival I was worried that it would be noisy as it is right in the middle of the restaurant strip, but I had a room at the back, looking out onto a courtyard and it was really quiet. The reception staff are very friendly and welcoming and of course, because it is Switzerland, speak excellent English. They were very helpful with sightseeing suggestions and restaurant recommendations. My room, while not large, was more than big enough and the bed was very comfortable. As stated, my room was at the back of the hotel, so I had very little street noise. I don't know what the rooms that overlook the street would be like. Breakfast was included in the",10,"2016",5

The electrical outlets were different tha. The rest of Europe, the front staff loaned us a converter for our whole stay, they also were able to tell us what train to take the track number and the time to the airport saving money and time.

"Hotel_Alexander","Great introduction to Switzerland","My husband and I had the pleasure of staying 2 nights at the Hotel Alexander. From the moment we walked in, (after a long overnight flight and then 3 hour stop over in Paris to wait for a connecting flight) we were greeted by the most friendly and helpful staff who ensured we were taken care of. Our room was immaculately clean, although a bit on the small side, with only 2 people, it met our needs sufficiently. The proximity of the Hotel to the train station was ideal for us, (less than a 5 min. walk) as we were often travelling by train from city to city in Switzerland. It is also conveniently located in the old town with a lot of restaurants and landmarks close by. We highly recommend this hotel and would not hesitate to book again in the future.",9,"2016",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Small but good location","It might be like this in all Zurich but we booked this hotel because it had a queen bed instead of a single and it turned out to be extremely small rooms.

It is well located (5 minute walk from train station and in the old part of town), clean and modern. The rooms are a little small by American standards but pretty normal for Zurich. There is free wifi, nice bathrooms, air conditioning and a very good breakfast (included in the room rate).

The next morning they agree to move me for 46 Swiss Francs. Then they tried charge me for both rooms the second night. They were so unfriendly too. Except the breakfast room. The breakfast woman was pleasant. Upon checking in they suggested paying in USD because it would be better for my USD based credit card.

They showed us to our accommodation around the corner at the Guest house. We had plenty of restaurants around the hotel and a supermarket right next to the hotel which was open from 8am- 9pm. The river is one street over. The room was small but normal for Europe. It had plenty plugs to charge our mobiles and 2 USB chargers. Tv in room but no kettle for a cuppa.

"Hotel_Alexander","Affordable twin room","Hotel Alexander is not a luxury hotel, but it is an affordable, quality choice in the heart of the old town of Zurich. Our twin bed room was tiny, but the separated twin beds, on opposite walls, were a nice change from the typical Swiss configuration of twin beds pushed together. The location, about a 7 minute walk from the train station, is quite good. Our room was air conditioned, and despite overlooking Neiderdorfstrasse, proved to be plenty quiet, even on a Saturday night.

Rooms are a bit small with not huge amounts of maneuvering room with luggage, etc. But it was easy to deal with that. Lots of different lighting options in the room including under-the-bed lighting that goes on/off automatically. Reception kindly gave us an adaptor because our European 2-prong one didn't fit any of the room plugs, although they did fit other rooms in Switzerland.

The hotel is on Neiderdorf which can be busy with the constant din of the city. Not too bad but we could hear it throughout the night. I'd say it's mid scale for a large city. We received a 10% discount because we had the Rick Steve's book. We would stay here again. Breakfast was included and typical of the region.",5,"2016",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Excellent location","The Hotel Alexander is located in Old Town, very near the train station. We liked it's central location and that is was near to many restaurants. We especially liked the Movie Restaurant located across the river near the train station. The hotel breakfast was included in the price of the room and there was plenty to select from, including eggs, yogurt, fruit, many different breads and rolls, meats, cheeses, cereals, and pastries. The room size was small, but we didn't spend much time in the room so it didn't matter. There is a small refrigerator in the room where we stored bottles of water that we bought at the small grocery store located next door to the hotel. This was very helpful because restaurants charge between $4-$6 for a bottle of water. We hotel could use fans",5,"2016",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Excellent location and very attentive and helpful staff","Fantastic location in Zurich's Old Town. Close to Central Train Station, Coop supermarket and all sightseeing. Coming from Australia, we found the hotel accommodation comparatively very expensive and very small, but we are sure this has to do with the Cost of Living differences between Switzerland and Australia - and not any fault of the Hotel Alexander!",5,"2016",4

She was enthusiastic and friendly and gave us lots of information on tours, where to go and what to do. She deserved commendation.

A neat breakfast area with a lovely selection of food available and served from 7.30 - 11.00 by a lovely lady (Sunday breakfast).

"Hotel_Alexander","Great Location! Great Stay","We stayed back in October and we loved everything about this hotel! It;s located very close to the HB and to many local bars and resturants. Considering the location, it was very quiet in our room. The room size was a great fit for two people and I specifically liked the large tub to soak in, in the bathroom. The temperature of the rooms always seemed to be a bit too warm for our liking but the windows were easy to open. We stayed for a week, so the breakfast got a bit repetitive for us but I think our stay was longer than most. Otherwise I would say it was amazing! A nice variety for even a picky eater. This is my second time to Zurich and would definelty stay if we ever made it a third time! The location can't be beat!",1,"2016",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Excellent reception & in house staff, very close to Zurich HB","This was my 2nd stay at this hotel. As always they have excellent reception & in house staff who are ready to help you with any need you might have. Room bookings are including free buffet breakfast. They have free coffee table also at the entrance, can take back to your room or use when you are going out. Antonio from their in house staff is a great guy.",1,"2016",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Surprising !","We have stayed for one night booking three rooms and a garage place for the car. Reading the reviews before going, but afterthe booking, I was expecting much less than what we really got in the end! Surprising was the cleanliness of the rooms, the quiet (and it was New Year's Eve!), the breakfast (small, but everything was there and in abundance!), the service staff (very kind, forthcoming and professional). The garage was not in the same building, but there's a place just 2mins walking distance away from there with reserved space. The car lift was fun. All members of the family have been very well, comfy beds, small rooms but enough space for what you actually need it for. Recommendation? Yes, definitely, you're in the core of the Old Town with all venues next door. Prices",1,"2016",4
"Hotel_Alexander","A Business Trip to Zurich","Booked this place through Booking.com. The Hotel is at a very good location, offers all basic facilities, and is good for short stays. The Rooms are very small though, nothing great to boast of. Buffet breakfast is average, gives the feel of European Small town hotels. Although looks overpriced, in a city like Zurich where everything is overpriced, this one offers a decent stay. 3 Stars to the hotel, 1 Star to the location",12,"2015",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Nice hotel in Zurich","Since I had researched a lot on the location of the hotel, so looking for it was easy. The receptionist was friendly and helpful. They serve fresh apples in our room everyday. And has complimentary water on our first night. Walking distance to the train station and shopping district. Many restaurants near the hotel.. Everything was good.",12,"2015",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Great Location","And friendly staff. Worth what you pay for by Swiss standards. Breakfast is not free if you stay at the guesthaus. The guesthaus is cheaper than the hotel. Breakfast was good and service was very good. They offer a discount if you book on their site but I would recommend you shop around on some travel sights.",12,"2015",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Price Justified","We stayed one night at the Hotel Alexander and in summary I believe the hotel is in accordance with a Swiss 3* standard. The rooms are rather small, but very quiet - even though we stayed there on a weekend (we had a room facing the courtyard) and clean. Downside: The mattress was very soft, which in my case caused back pain. The receptionists were all very friendly and helpful. The breakfast buffet was tasty and offered a big choice. I would have loved some fresh fruit salad - and better coffee. But all in all very satisfying. The price for the room is rather on the lower end compared to other hotels at such a great location (with equal standard) - therefore I can recommend a stay there as ""you get what you pay""!",12,"2015",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Good Location, Good Breakfast","Good Location, in the heart of the city. Also good breakfast. I stayed only for a short time mostly just slept, but i liked the location very much, close to everything! Sleep was good, no interruptions. Good Internet also.",11,"2015",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Clean friendly and convenient","Great location in the old town. The staff are all friendly and very helpful. The room was a little small but very clean and had all the required amenities. The breakfast was included and suitable, the scrambled eggs were delicious. The pillows were not to my comfort and could hear the church bells all night which from speaking to colleagues and locals is normal for most hotels and rooms in Zurich. The river is nearby and a short walk to the lake. Recommended for a few nights.",11,"2015",3
"Hotel_Alexander","Great Zurich hotel","The Alexander Hotel in Zurich is a great place to stay for a few days. It is a short walk from the central train station, across the bridge in the old city. You can walk everywhere from this hotel or buy a Zurich pass and us the tram system easily. The staff, especially Rina Roll helped make our stay great. She was friendly and always had good suggestions for us. The rooms are small but clean, modern and quiet. The bathroom is on the small side but worked for the two of us. Breakfast in the morning has a variety of items, hot and cold. Try the local apple juice that the hotel puts out...it's delicious. Zurich is expensive all around but we got a great rate ($235) considering the other hotels in the area are much higher!",11,"2015",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Bed and location","Zurich is always impressive with prices and rooms sizes, and this hotel is not an exception. Add really average breakfast, and here you go. But great beds and perfect location, indeed. I'm happy it was my company to pay for it, not me.",11,"2015",3
"Hotel_Alexander","A Week in Zurich","We stayed at the Hotel Alexander and found it to be a real nice quiet room and it was convenient to everything. There are lots of restaurants in the neighborhood and there is easy access to trams and the railroad station. The breakfast buffet was super and the staff was helpful and always cheery.",11,"2015",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Great hotel!","Hotel staff at reception and breakfast are very friendly, professional and helpful. My room and bathroom both very clean. Excellent location only a 10-15 minute very easy walk from train station. Centrally located in the heart of all tourist attractions. Delicious breakfast buffet includes scrambled eggs and all the typicalEuro buffet items. I would definitely stay here again, great value for the money. Note: my room was on the first floor overlooking hotel entrance, very busy noisy street with tourists. With my window closed I could barely hear any outside noise and my sleep was not at all disrupted.",10,"2015",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Excellent location! Exquisite Service with Care! Spacious, clean and comfortable rooms!","Reserved 1 Family room and 1 Twin room directly with the hotel. Reservation staff, Mr Aram was very prompt in replying to my queries concerning wheelchair accessibility. When we arrived at the hotel, our rooms was not ready for us to check-in. The Reception staff tagged our luggage and inform us that they will bring our luggage to our rooms. When we returned to Hotel Alexander in the evening, another Reception staff was concern whether my mom on mobility wheelchair is able to enter into the Family room. She showed us the room and inform us that if does not fit, she will change to another room. Fortunately, my mom was able to occupy the Family room. When we entered our rooms, our luggage was in as promised by the morning reception staff. Both rooms are spacious, clean, modern",10,"2015",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Great location. Clean, comfortable, quiet.","Lovely boutique, business hotel in great location. The staff was wonderful (especially Rina at the front desk). Clean, comfortable and quiet. Our room had large windows that opened onto a lovely courtyard away from the busy pedestrian traffic. Best bed/pillows on our visit to Switzerland. A perfect hotel for your arrival into Switzerland or for your last night - easy access to the train station. All in a charming location in the old town/Niederdorf area. A+",10,"2015",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Weekend Break","Stayed in this hotel for one night & we had a very pleasant stay. Reception staff were very welcoming & friendly. Room was spotlessly clean & had everything you would need. Beds were comfy & it was very quiet. Lovely breakfast with something for everyone. Our only slight criticism was there not being facilities for a hot drink in our room on our return from our night out. There was water & some apples though which we enjoyed. We would definitely stay here again should we ever return to Zurich.",10,"2015",5
"Hotel_Alexander","An Easy Walk from The Train Station","We stayed in the guest house which is just up one block from the main hotel. Located on a quiet lane, our room overlooked a very nice, green courtyard. It wasn't fancy, but spotlessly clean with nice linens and big fluffy towels. The hotel staff was friendly and wecoming. The breakfast was not included but we did have it on our first morning. As with European breakfasts it was healthy and filling with plenty of excellent coffee. This hotel suited our needs perfectly and we highly recommend it. The Jura coffee machine dispensing fabulous free espresso in the lobby and free local crisp apples was a very nice touch as well.",9,"2015",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Zurich Old Town","Very nice tourist or mid-level business class hotel located in the middle of Old Town. About a 10 minute walk from the main train station. Staff is excellent and very helpful...they all speak multiple languages and know Zurich well. Breakfast is included with your stay and it is very well done with fresh basic food. Attached to the Hotel is the Alexis restaurant...owned by same family/company. It is very nice with good, basic menu with good pricing (for Zurich). I like this Hotel and restaurant due to location, ease to train station, value and professional staff. Try it.",9,"2015",4
"Hotel_Alexander","An OK hotel","The hotel was not as bad as I thought it would be. As a 3 star hotel it has good amenities in the room and the breakfast was delicious with lots of varieties. However the hotel is located at a pedestrian area at the old town and it's hard to reach by car. Parking must be reserved or else u would end up like us paying 43 CHF for 24 hours ! However, the price tag that we paid for the hotel was too expensive for 3 stars!",9,"2015",3
"Hotel_Alexander","Family run and in the heart of everything!","This hotel is located on Niederdorfstrasse, which is a cobblestone walking passage that parallels the main road. No cars are allowed on this passage and it is only a 5-10 minute walk from the Central Zurich train Station. Running thru the list of needs online included: Air Conditioning, Free Wi-Fi, Breakfast, all included.......and affordable!..I'm in! Little did we know that we arrived on the Saturday night of the Niederdorf Festival celebrating the area's benefits......which includes plenty of partying and drinking. Imagine being on Bourbon St. on any weekend.....but incredibly the room was nearly impervious to the sounds outside and you couldn't tell at all that there was quite the to-do going on just outside the front door. VERY helpful staff as we arrived LATE on a Sat.",9,"2015",4
"Hotel_Alexander","A great hotel in heart of Zurich Old Town - Fun!!!!","We have a room in the back with great A/C. At the time there was a festival going on and it make it even more fun. Zurich is a small romantic city. Love the hotel as it was only a block to the river. It was near everything and breakfast was included. I would stay here again. The rate was good for the value.",9,"2015",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Decent, well located","No frills, basic rooms and amenities, easy walking distance to sights. Very expensive for what it is, but this seems par for the course in Zurich. The room was listed as having air conditioning; the hotel doesn't actually have air conditioning, but rather, they put a standing fan-like contraption in the room. It was weak, but better than nothing.",8,"2015",3
"Hotel_Alexander","Good hotel, great location","The hotel is perfectly located, right in the historic center. Staff is very helpful and provide a great experience at check in and out. Rooms are spacious with basic amenities. Bed mattress is very firm so if you don't like this, be warned. Car parking costs chf30 per day and is located nearby. Access is by car elevator, which is a crazy expetience!!",8,"2015",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Nice little hotel... Value for money","Great location with many restaurants and pubs all around. There's a great restaurant right opposite the hotel. And next to it on either side too. Very helpful friendly staff. Rooms and toilets are quite small. Gets a little noisy with all the pubs around especially since we stayed during the weekend. But certainly worth it.",8,"2015",3
"Hotel_Alexander","Lovely Surprise in Old Town","Stayed here for 1 night on a rainy summer afternoon of March 2015. We went with very low expectation given the price and we had booked the hostel (sister property of the hotel) which is one lane behind the hotel. At arriving at the hostel, we were told to collect our keys at the front desk of the hotel. Being tired after a long flight, I was not amused and rather irritated. The cheerful staff at the hotel reception with perfect English made my irritation go away instantly. Infact, they informed me I was upgraded to the Hotel (from the hostel) !! That really cheered me up. Going into the room, it was obvious that this was a compact room. It was newly renovated, really clean and well lit bath. The window overlooked the alley below and the charm of the old city. The heaters",8,"2015",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Excellent location, very clean","Stayed in this hotel on transit in Zurich for one night, it was worth traveling from the airport and spending the night in the old town of Zurich, the location of the hotel is excellent, close to the main train station, a few meters from the lake, and right in the old town. The hotel was very clean and had spacious rooms.",8,"2015",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Very nice European hotel","Stayed here three nights. Small entry door from street was very deceiving. Very friendly and helpful staff. Clean and modern rooms with a great breakfast as well Perfect location to walk around old city and ten minutes to train station. Good value and would stay here again",8,"2015",3
"Hotel_Alexander","Charming hotel!","We just spent six nights here. Very clean and the staff made us feel like family! Rinna greeted us with a smile and offered to help us with anything we needed. We'd asked for a room off the street and with AC and they made sure that's what we got. Small room but big enough...never spent much time in it. Very convenient to train station and in the heart of Old Town. Free wifi! If I ever go to Zurich again, I'll definitely stay there! And I hope I do go again; I think I left my heart in Zurich!",8,"2015",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Maybe not for us.","The hotel faces one of the main walk streets of Zurich. The staff was excelent and helped us a lot with some inquiries. But we found the place more like a hostel, and the location would be perfect for those who want to be in the middle of the fuzz. Good breakfast. We left the city one day earlier than the original plan.",7,"2015",3
"Hotel_Alexander","Great hotel in a lovely city built for bankers on huge salaries","I had a great stay at the Hotel Alexander in summer 2014. The room was recently renovated, modern and exceptionally clean. And the stay got better and better each day as I experienced the wonderful service this hotel has to offer. The staff were very impressive. I booked a single room which was perfectly fine for 1 person. I asked for a quiet room at the back of the hotel and experienced no noise whatsoever and slept very well. The service at the hotel was absolutely outstanding. Staff couldn't do enough for you. The room itself had everything a guest could possibly need - an empty small fridge, even an all countries power point so you can just plug your electrics right in. The hotel had free wifi and my rate included a free buffet breakfast which was basic but did the job",7,"2015",5
"Hotel_Alexander","small, nice hotel near HBF","Spent one night at the Alexander because of its proximity to Zurich's central station, where I had to catch an early morning train. I had room on top floor on the interior, courtyard side, so didn't hear any street noise (which is a good thing, since the hotel sits on a busy pedestrian street in the heart of the tourist district). Room was of decent size, spotlessly clean, simply but well appointed. Wifi was strong. Complimentary apple, chocolates, and water in the room were nice touches. Staff was friendly and efficient. A/C was rather weak, keeping the room less warm rather than cool on a horribly hot day.",7,"2015",4
"Hotel_Alexander","They have Air Conditioning & Reserve your Parking spot in advance if you can","I'm here during the heat wave and thankfully they have air conditioning. It's not perfect like in the USA (I live in FL and must have AC.). I specifically requested a low floor and it has been pretty cool. Even some of the more expensive hotels near by don't have AC and I see folks with their windows open. I was able to sleep well. Small room, perfect for 2 people. Excellent, fast free wifi. GREAT location. You can walk all over Old Town and down to Lake Zurich to see the swans. Breakfast was included in my rate and was good for me,",7,"2015",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Nice hotel, loud location","The Hotel Alexander has many fine points. Air conditioning, proximity to the train station, clean efficient rooms. Unfortunately, the location also works against it because the bar and nightclub crowd party all night and make significant noise out in the street. I was awakened numerous times during the night and did not feel like I had a good night's sleep. In the morning, the area still has many hungover zombies out on the street and the neighborhood has been trashed with litter. If you like to party then this is the neighborhood for you. If you like to sleep, not so much. Hotel Alexander does a good job with the elements it has control over. If you choose to stay here, insist on a room as far away from the street as possible and bring earplugs. The hotel does offer a",7,"2015",3
"Hotel_Alexander","Good hotel, good location.","The hotel located in the heart of the beautiful old town, it is surrounded by many places to eat and next door to a supermarket which is even open on Sundays It was very easy to get around Zurich on the tram and getting to the train station is about 5-8 mins, also bus stations are very closed convenient. Whilst our room was not very big, it was perfectly formed and extremely well thought out and the room was very clean. Wi-Fi was a bit slow. Staffs were nice and friendly, Breakfast quite good. A real fine hotel – we will return!",6,"2015",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Early June 2015 Vacation","We stayed @ Hotel Alexander while in Zurich in the early summer and found this to be a very nice hotel and the location was great, you leave the hotel and you are right in the middle of it all. The only negative was that the upper level room we had for the 3 of us was quite warm but I blame the the unseasonable weather more than the hotel, once the rain came the room cooled down. I would recommend the hotel for the location and all the staff as they were very friendly and helpful to any request we had. If you need a nice hotel in Zurich at a fair price, this is your place.",6,"2015",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Small and centrally located","This small hotel is located in the heart of the old town, just by a busy walking street. The main railway station is just a short walk away. Staff was friendly and the room was clean and modern. Just few noise came to the room from the busy street below. Wifi was a bit slow, though. Breakfast was ok. This wasn't the hotel of my dreams, but it filled all my expectations.",6,"2015",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Great location","Very good moderately priced hotel within walking distance of the old town only one street back from the river and around the corner form the tram stop. Room was very clean and modern. Breakfast was a bonus with an extended continental breakfast available every day. It was very easy to get around Zurich on the tram and made getting to the train station and bus station very convenient",6,"2015",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Nice hotel","Hotel location is good. Walk about 5-8 mins to train station. There are many restaurant and bar , night life nearby and dinner night it have a little bit noisy. The room is nice and bigger than i expect, boutique hotel . There are 3mins walk to river and tram station. Staffs are nice and friendly. Breakfast quite good.",6,"2015",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Absolutely ideal!","I was looking for a hotel close to the station since I was travelling onto Munich after 3 nights in Zurich. I chose well! Whomever is behind the room design knows a thing or two. Whilst my room was small, it was perfectly formed and extremely well thought out. It had absolutely everything a (business) traveller would need including free internet. Warm and friendly staff, excellent breakfast, great bed with high quality linen and immaculate if tiny bathroom again with high quality towelling. And as for value for money - it simply cannot be beaten. Whilst it is bang in the heart of the beautiful old town, the double glazing was good enough not to hear the late night party goers. It is surrounded by many places to eat and next door to a supermarket which is even open on",6,"2015",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Well located, staff are very friendly, internet great","This is a very well priced hotel in Geneva, I was nervous as it does not seem to have a star rating but with a price like this it was hard to resist and i was very satisfied. The internet worked well and was free, the staff were extremely friendly and the room and hotel were very clean with hot water at all times. The tram service at the hotel is close and convenient and while you don' t get room service or dinner there are a lot of restaurants and shops nearby. It is not luxury but would you expect that at this price?",6,"2015",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Nice boutique hotel","This is a nice boutique hotel located in a bustling area of town. The night life nearby is... Unique! There are a few gentlemens clubs and adult stores near, but do not let this bother you! The staff is friendly and helpful! In general it is a nice, quiet place to stay!",5,"2015",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Fantastic experience","I loved this Hotel and had 2 nights there. Great location. Great staff. Great breakfast. Other 5* reviewers say it all - totally agree. The warm welcome is what most sticks in my mind. Loved going out the door in the evening to find somewhere nice to eat - really recommend the Fondue at Hotel Adler up the road -sit outside on the street til late then go back to Hotel Alexander to sleep- surprisingly quiet given its central location, but then no cars on that section - perfect. Get up and go to see GrossMunster directly along the little street and then cross the Bridge to see Fraumunster - fantastic! Really recommend. Very clean.",5,"2015",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Great service and Great Location","This Hotel is one block from a main road and a river. There are numerous places to eat and shop in the neighborhood. The Hotel staff were the most pleasant and helpful that we encountered during our European visit. It's an easy walk to the main train station and to the Tour Bus meeting point. They also arranged a reasonable cost shuttle to the airport upon our departure from Zurich. Note that your travel agent may not be able to book this hotel, we booked it on their website.",5,"2015",5
"Hotel_Alexander","""Spot on customer service!""","Stayed a total of 6 nights in April. We were drawn to the hotel by its location and strong reviews & we weren't disappointed. Located less than 500 yards from the main train station in the ""old town"", off of the famous Niederdorfstasse, this hotel is in a perfect location. A whole slew of pubs, restaurants & shopping within walking distance. Wonderful people watching! Zurich is such a charming city. My wife & I loved the place. We had room 308 facing the courtyard away from any street noise. The room was small and very modern & clean. Not a lot of space for 2 suitcases. However, the ""fluffy"" king size bed made up for it (I'm 6'4""). The bathroom & shower were just right. Free WiFi had a strong signal. We weren't bumped off once. Breakfast was included. Typical Europe style.",5,"2015",5
"Hotel_Alexander","A nice small Boutique hotel in zurich Center","Great location in old town Zurich. A small but nice , clean, very modern rooms. Just 7 minutes by walking from the main train station, all shopping areas and main BahnHofStrassa - the famous shopping street, are in 10 min. walking.",4,"2015",5
"Hotel_Alexander","3-night stopover","Modern, neat, clean rooms. Friendly and welcoming staff. Quick jaunt to train station. (Maybe a 10 minute stroll.) Suitable for a quick tourist visit to Zurich. Tip: Safari Bar around the corner on Zahringer Strasse a good bet for a cold beer.",4,"2015",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Great location","This is a nice little hotel, the rooms although fairly basic are modern and very clean. The hotel is in a great location fronting on a cobbled street with a great atmosphere and lots of friendly people have a a good time. It's just a few minutes walk away fro the waterfront which has great views of the mountains in the distance. The staff are really friendly and always say hello when entering the hotel. Breakfast is basic but what they have is nice and tasty, the ladies working are friendly and helpful. I would recommend this hotel for short stays. I was here on business which was about 20minute walk from the business area and enjoyed the walk to the office. Over all very pleased!",4,"2015",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Perfect choice if you travel with a baby!","It was our first travel with our 1 year old baby. Our stay in the Alexander Hotel has been absolutely perfect. The super friendly staff of the hotel provided us all we needed (baby bed, baby chairs for the breakfast, etc.). The location is also very convenient: really close to the Zurich main train station. You also find plenty of restaurants and supermarkets nearby. Overall: Hotel Alexander is the perfect choice if you are travelling with a baby to Zurich.",4,"2015",5
"Hotel_Alexander","A Great Find","The hotel is about a 10 minute walk from the train station. The prices are very good (for Zurich), the beds are quite comfortable, free internet access is excellent, breakfast not extraordinary but quite satisfactory. TIPS 1. If you are arriving at Zurich airport you can take the train to the Zurich Main Train Station (Hauptbanhof, or Zurich HBF on the signs) and then walk to the hotel. 2. There is a small supermarket a short distance from the hotel, and a Coop a little further away (you'll pass it if you walk here from the train station. About an hour or two before closing, both of these supermarkets will put 50% off stickers on their sandwiches, sushi, salads, and some other food items. Grab some of those and a bottle of Swiss wine and have a nice picnic along the river",3,"2015",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Nice hotel near train station","It is across the river from the main train station, an easy walk. (No parking, so this is not a hotel if you are driving, but great if you are using train). Very friendly staff, nice décor, good value for money considering how expensive Zurich is. Rooms are a bit small, but not as tiny as some I have seen in Europe. Nice touch is power strip with four different international plugs (but surpisingly NOT for USA). Only minor shock is that the surrounding area has several strip or sex clubs (brothels?). According to a friend I met, this is the ""nicer"" or ""safer"" of the two red light districts. The entrances were low key and if you ignore them it is not an issue, but if you are with children you may want to stick to the other side of the river (the train station side).",3,"2015",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Great location , average hotel","The two big advantages of this hotel are the good friendly staff and great location. The hotel itself is on rather budget side. The building is so small that even a small renovation of the reception area that was on during our short stay made the whole place look abandoned . Our room was clean and warm but small and on the top of everything it had a glass door to the toilet. Not great experience overall.",2,"2015",3
"Hotel_Alexander","Enjoyed ourselves!!","The hotel is undergoing renovations and on arrival we were told that if the noise is too much for us they would understand if we want to change hotels. As a matter of fact the renovations did not affect us. Most of the time we were outside touring so apart from a slight inconvenience when coming back at night (you have to go next door to have the lobby door opened) - it shouldn't prevent you from staying at the hotel. Location - excellent (5 min from Hauptbahnhof, Bahnhofstrasse) on the Niederdorfstrasse Room - very clean and pleasant. Bed comfortable, despite the cold outside, room was warm (not too warm) and inviting. Bathroom - clean. Shower was fine for me (small and petite) my husband said it took some time to get used to the size. It closes with a shower curtain - I",2,"2015",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Can't fault this hotel","After coming out the wrong end of the main train and being directed to jump on the number 4 tram, we easily found the hotel, but not the reception. At the moment it is next door, whilst the normal reception is being renovated. We were delighted with our triple room... It was surprisingly large. The bathroom had everything you needed. Breakfast buffet is more than adequate and particularly nice are the fresh loaves of bread. Nothing is too much trouble for the staff. In the very informative 'newsletter' in the room (with all the usual hotel information), there were great tips. One was a recommendation of the Raclette Stubn in the next street. It seems to be connected to the hotel, but is worth going to. We were lucky to get a table, but plenty were turned away. In other words,",1,"2015",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Great location, clean and tidy rooms","My partner and I stayed for two nights in January at Hotel Alexander. The rooms are small, but are modern and well thought out from an efficiency perspective; unless you're planning on spending a lot of your waking hours in the room, this should not be an issue (as there is a lot to see in Zurich!). WiFi speed was reasonable, and the included breakfast was tasty with enough variety to suit our needs. Overall the hotel was well located in the old town, is clean, and the service friendly and prompt. We would stay here again if on vacation.",1,"2015",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Great position, clean and friendly","The hotel is located at a great spot, in the center of Zurich and just a few minutes walk from the train station (approx. 5-7 minutes walk with luggage from train station). It is clean and recently renovated with very friendly staff. The breakfast was good, with good variety. The room was a bit small but was comfortable and had all the commodities. Overall value for money and definitely will return!",12,"2014",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Good hotel - upmarket room","Picked this hotel at last minute through hotels.com. Short walk across the river from Zurich main train station to the 'old town'. Apparently this used to be a red light district but apart from a couple of obvious 'hostels', this is now a very quaint part of town. Hotel reception was a little out dated but the room was excellent - very modern, clean with fantastic shower. Breakfast (included) was adequate and plentiful. Good value.",12,"2014",4
"Hotel_Alexander","We had a great stay at the Hotel Alexander.","I recently stayed for three nights at the Hotel Alexander. It was a perfect place to stay, central and handy to everything. We stayed in one of the recently renovated twin rooms in the hotel. Clean, comfortable, great value. It's not luxurious, but neither is the price. The staff were always friendly and helpful, and spoke excellent English. Breakfast was included, a good selection.",11,"2014",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Finally we have air conditioning!!","We really liked this hotel a lot. The room was very nice and there was room to move around. The air conditioning was so nice, especially at night. The location was central and we walked forever all over Zurich. We ate dinner at the hotel restaurant and the food was very good. We would stay here again.",11,"2014",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Short visit","I didn't stay in this hotel but I had an experience which I feel is worth noting. I arrived in Zurich 22nd October 2014 at 9:30pm on a Tuesday night. I have been travelling all this year but the accommodation I had been expecting this night had fallen through. I had no choice but to go into the city of Zurich and ask at whichever hotel I randomly arrived at. After checking a couple of hotels I found that my chances were very slim indeed. I was advised that just about every hotel room in the city was booked out this night and even if I could find a room, it would be very costly. The third hotel I checked was Hotel-Alexander. It was about 10:50pm at this stage and I spoke to a man named Wellington. This man made a couple of calls for me and found a single room for 180 francs for",11,"2014",5
"Hotel_Alexander","4 stars for a ""moderate"" experience","In fairness to the Hotel Alexander, this was our last hotel during our stay in Switzerland and our ""cheapest"". As they say, you get what you pay for...and we did. We had a tiny, clean room. Bathroom was very clean and tiny as well (shower curtain because it was too small for any glass doors). Breakfast was adequate. The staff we met was exceptionally polite. It was convenient to the train station and the old city. it was not elegant, spacious or luxurious in any way.",10,"2014",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Right in the Heart of Zurich","This lovely little hotel is waking distance from the Central Zurich train station and right in the heart of the old town. Restaurants and shopping are all around us and with the river only one block away all the best sights of Zurich are close by. The rooms are small but very comfortable and well-equipped, a real breakfast is included, and wifi is free throughout the hotel. The service and staff are outstanding. Being on the second floor, there is some street noise outside but the closed window and air conditioning blocks it completely. I would definitely stay here again.",10,"2014",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Great stay in Zurich every time","My family has stayed at the Hotel Alexander for years. The staff is hospitable and genuine, the rooms are always clean, comfortable, and well appointed (wifi works great!), and the location is close to everything in old town Zurich. Plus it's very reasonably priced. Their Guesthouse option is an even better bargain and just as comfortable as the main hotel, in my opinion. When in Zurich, I don't stay anywhere else.",10,"2014",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Great spot to stay in Zurich.","We stayed in the Alexander for 3 nights and found it to be an excellent hotel. It is in a great spot in the old Quarter and walking distance to all the interesting spots. It is centrally positioned for eating , plenty of restaurants and lots to see if you just want to wander. The staff were very helpful, the breakfast was great and while the rooms are smallish they were more than adequate and spotlessly clean. Our room faced the street but there was little noise.",10,"2014",4
"Hotel_Alexander","second visit, still great!","This was our second visit here and we were not disappointed! Room was smaller than before, but still very clean with very comfortable beds. We arrived late afternoon and after checking in and changing, we headed out into Zurich - Bahnhofsrasse and Niederdorf neighborhoods; Great shopping and food and of course the walk along the river is magical! Breakast is great here with eggs, breads, birchermüesli, fruit, cheeses, meats and all sorts of coffees.... Can't wait to return!",10,"2014",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Great hotel, even better price!","Got a great price for this hotel and was very modern and had everything we needed. Room was clean and comfortable and very spacious. There are lots of restaurants and bars around but we didn't hear any noise from the street (and we had a room that faced the street). Free Wifi worked great. Staff were really friendly and checked us in early and upgraded our room. Everything was walking distance from the hotel, including the train station which is a 5 min walk. Perfect hotel, would definitely stay again.",10,"2014",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Location, location, location","Love to walk everywhere to explore cities. This was the perfect location for us. Got to see the city on foot, and got to the train station in 5 minutes for our trips outside the city. Rooms are small, but clean. The bathroom was small but very modern. The breakfast was lovely and there was a coffee machine in the lobby at 6:30 AM.",9,"2014",5
"Hotel_Alexander","A Great Find","The hotel is close to the train station (5 to 10 minutes, depending on which streets you take). There are many restaurants and bars near the hotel -- perhaps too many so request a quiet room if you have that option. The bed is quite comfortable and my double room at least was a good size: not large but also not cramped. Breakfast is good. Given what hotels can cost in Switzerland and in Zurich in particular, this is a good value hotel.",9,"2014",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Ideal Hotel in Zurich for Value Conscience Travelers","Hotel Alexander is perfectly located in Zurich; right downtown in the old part of town within walking distance of all the major sites and piers for lake boat rides. There is a very good restaurant across the street and your typical Italian Gelatio ice cream (they make good pasta and pizzas too) next door. Note, this is not a 4 or 5 star Hotel; it's a ""value"" for European travelers. Rooms are comfortable and good ventilation in both the main hotel and their ""Guest House"" (the economy option)........private baths in all rooms and staff was excellent.......especially... *Catherina (nick name ""Rina"") *the other Catherina *the long time Bell man (can't remember his name) and *Arthur, the other Bell man Great Place in an Interesting City, Zurich note if you have a care, it is",9,"2014",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Clean cozy very nice hotel","I really like this hotel, the room is small, but is very clean and cozy, the design is so functional. The location is very good, it is close to train station and shopping. The breakfast has a lot of choice and taste good. By the way, the restaurants beside it is also good, not sure if they are the same owner.",9,"2014",5
"Hotel_Alexander","functional and good value (for Zurich)","The location is very good. You can easily walk to most of the places you would want to go in central Zurich. The price is very reasonable (for Zurich). The rooms are snug..... but clean and functional. Same for the bath. Breakfast is good. It's not fancy or luxury....... but it works very well for a few day's stay in Zurich. The staff were helpful and friendly. I was a bit surprised when they wanted us to pay for the room in advance..... but that made check out easy. The room was quiet until morning when the garbage (or perhaps delivery) truck made it's appearance in the alley below our window. This may be an issue if you plan to sleep in. But it's not an issue if you plan to be up and about. There is nothing special about it (other than a good location), but",8,"2014",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Convenient Location!","Pleasant hotel clean & cozy w/air conditioning! Nice in the warm Summer months. Friendly/helpful staff and close to tram & train, as well as, restaurants & shopping. Small rooms but plenty of room for 2! Easy to get to hotel from Zurich airport by tram #10.",8,"2014",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Reasonably (for Zurich) priced hotel in the centre of city","It's a bit like a premier inn or travel lodge (uk hotels), with little to offer other than rooms and breakfast room. However the place is clean and tidy, and actually a nice little hotel in a really convenient location. I've been staying here for work regularly for the last few months and going to stay so longer still. They've been accommodating about room choices etc. Hotel has free wifi, which can be fast enough to stream but not all the time. you have to get a free 24hr username and password from reception. a little annoying, but you just ask every day. It's on a main street which can be noisy but the rooms seem very tranquil when in them. I've never had any issues with noise, but others I know had on front facing rooms. higher you go the better. If I was coming to zurich",8,"2014",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Excellent service, clean and nice room, superb location","We stayed at hotel Alexander for one night, but we'd love to spend longer time there. A perfect place to recharge our batteries! It's located in the middle of everything: the old town, by the river, in a lively restaurant- and shopping street, a 5-10 minutes walk from the train station. It's amazingly quiet considering it's location. The bed was comfortable and large (we had a queen bed). The breakfast room is small, but inviting, with good food. We will definitely come back to Hotel Alexander out next visit to Zurich. Thank you!",8,"2014",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Cozy","The hotel was located in the heart of the city, which was a huge plus, the free high speed internet was again no problem. I really liked the stay there. The elevator was quite small, but the building is not that high, so there stairs are a good option too.",7,"2014",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Very nice","After been badly ripped off by ibis hotel near airport Zurich I got myself booked in this hotel and it was a wonderful experience staying there everything was just outside the hotel bars cafés shisha smoke u just name it and it's outside the hotel.Price they charged me was unbelievable it was the lowest of all hotel across for single room stay I was given a double room nice a comfy beds very nice bathroom highly secured rooms very clean bathrooms friendly staff free wifi for all your devices .Great hotel thanks to the management. And cheer keep it up",7,"2014",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Great value for money, excellent location","This hotel is just right for a short stay in Zurich. Location is great, in the picturesque Old Town and within walking distance of a lot of sights, restaurants, and shops. Tram stop just a few steps away. Clean, newly renovated rooms with AC. Free wifi and good quality breakfast included in the rates. The lady at the reception desk was very helpful and patient with all of my questions. My only gripe was the quality of the towels, jarringly out of sync with everything else the hotel offered. Will definitely stay here again if in Zurich for only 1-2 nights.",7,"2014",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Nice for the price","We were staying in the dependance building. Small rooms but clean bed and clean shower. Breakfast in the main building, but its not even a 2 minute walk. Good breakfast. Friendly staff. Wifi code only lasts 24hrs so you need to get a new pass at the front desk. Location is perfect. Lots to see and so many restaurants in walking distance. Dependance building is next to the redlight district, in the evenings you notice. But its not troublesome The parking arrangent was very confusing",7,"2014",3
"Hotel_Alexander","delightful and charming service; right in the middle of Old Town","Checkin was efficient and cordial - wifi worked great - for as many devices as you needed. We needed a corkscrew - so we were given one gratis. Location was superb - easy walk with luggage from the trian station. Lovely to stroll all the old cobbled streets, along the river, sit at a cafe. Got to watch some world cup soccer at a local pub less than a block away. Breakfast was quite splendid. lots of meats, eggs - ""oeuf a la coque"" was only one of three ways to boil an egg. Croissants; juices; good coffee. Charming service. bed was comfortable. did not hear any noise ...even after the soccer match. Well worth the stay ....",7,"2014",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Compact comfort","This hotel fills up fast in the summer months and is popular because of its superb location in the heart of Zurich near practically all the attractions, the main station and the shopping district of Bahnhof Strasse. The entrance is a small doorway along a row of shops on a cobbled street and quite nondescript. The reception is small, there is no business centre but rooms are modern, new, clean and comfortable. Service was friendly and efficient and the breakfast was good and substantial. Stay here if your time in Zurich is short and you need an efficient location for for your visit and don't plan to spend too much time in doors.",7,"2014",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Perfect for my 1 night stay","I booked 3 rooms here for my siblings and I. Price for chf 190 for their business room. Email correspondence was speedy and efficient. Price was spot on for what we were getting. I have stayed in Zurich before so I know the Old Town area is nicer to stay at. Hotel Alexander's location was wonderful, smack dab in the middle of charming Old Town. Loads of restaurants within walking distance and the tram to main train station stops around 50meters away. Room was good sized and clean (renovated in 2012). Well thought out lighting. Free fruit and chocolate. Rather weak water pressure in the shower and towels a bit too thin. Room was reasonably quiet...I could hear my neighboring room through the bathroom but once I closed the bathroom door, it was quiet again. I think",6,"2014",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Convenient location, good price, nice breakfast","This was very convenient for a meeting at the Federal Institute of Technology which is just up the street and then up a short walkway with 137 steps; in the other direction, across a scenic bridge it is only a few blocks to the main shopping street (Banhofstrasse); also not far from the Zurichsee and a short walk to the main train station. Later in the evenings, this location appears to be centered in the red light district. Rooms were nice, clean, and included free fast internet, refrigerators, and a very nice full breakfast. The receptionists were always very friendly and helpful. There is no fitness facility but the very well organized indoor city swimming pool (Hallenbad) is a short walk from the hotel (I used it every day for the week I stayed at this hotel). Bottled",6,"2014",3
"Hotel_Alexander","Comfortable Hotel","We had made reservations to stay at the Guesthouses and got upgraded to the regular hotel. Its an easy walk from the train station and they were able to let us check in at 10am. There were chocolates on the pillows, AC, Fridge, and one of the best wifi's during our stay in Switzerland. We did not take advantage of breakfast. Check out was quick and easy.",6,"2014",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Small, smaller, smallest but very convenient!","Small inexpensive hotel in the middle of Zürich. Small but modern room. Bathroom also small. Breakfast was good. Car parking close to hotel but needs to be reserved in advance. Price/quality for Zürich standards very good. Great hotel for one or two night stay when you just need a good bed in the center of town! Only minor point is the water pressure in the shower.",6,"2014",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Hotel in Zurich, Switzerland","Excellent location in the middle of all the shopping. Walking distance from the train station. Breakfast was good. The beds were not the best arrangement. We had my husband and I along with my 9 year old boy and they put 3 cots in the room it seemed. 2 pushed together and one against the wall.",6,"2014",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Nice Stay","Stayed solely at the Alexander's for one night during March 2014. It's a small nice hotel at the heart of Zurich old city , right on a a street with a lot of restaurants a coffee shops. (No noise at night) The check-in was quick and also got a free ""upgrade"" to a room with a king size bed. The room was small but well decorated and clean, its looks like it was renovated lately. The morning breakfast was ok , similar to other European hotels: coffee,juices,eggs together with variety of cheese and meat. Friendly reception staff. A tip: if you a are going there with a rented car, the hotel parking is hard to find and relatively far from the hotel.",6,"2014",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Clean and Well Located","Walkable from the train station, this nice, small hotel is clean and well located in Old Town. The rooms are updated and modern, even though quite small. We would stay here again. Located near lots of restaurants and sites to visit, just across the river from Bahnhofstrasse and train station.",6,"2014",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Not much beats this for a Rocker","Always nervous about hotels in the ""old town"" can disguise a great deal. Wrong. This place is a gem, really clean no frills great modern minimalist room, superb shower, soap and personal care. Great bed but make sure you get a double if you are on your own and large, they are designed for gnomes. Local area lovely and seedy, great cafes and bars loads of life going on. Easy access to the raii way and with typical Swiss effiscience gets you to where you need to be. Language an issue but speak English loud enough they understand. Breakfast really good simple and all you need too! Would recommend. Going to see the Rolling Stones so a great place to come back to for a simple trip home. Make sure you take the correct plugs, the Swiss are not in sync with Europe, (or anybody) they",5,"2014",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Central Location Near Zurich Hauptbanhof","The location of the hotel is excellent. It is about a 5-10 minute walk to the Zurich train station. This was perfect for me since I was using the train daily. The breakfast was relatively simple but satisfying. The room itself was modern and clean yet a little bit small. The only downside of this hotel is the noise. Even though it is a very decently-priced hotel right in the heart of Zurich, it can get a little bit noisy at night. However, the hotel tries to address this problem by using soundproof windows. When I stayed there, it generally wasn't a problem except sometimes at 1-2am, it would be possible to hear drunks yelling and shouting outside. Overall, this is an excellent hotel, and I would definitely consider staying here again.",5,"2014",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Superb location, close to everything","Just coming to end of a wonderful 3 night stay at Hotel Alexander, would definitely come again.

"Hotel_Alexander","Good location, rooms a bit small.","Just needed a hotel for a single night and this property was well located for my meeting. Good part of town with many cafes and bars right outside the door. Breakfast was very good but the dining room was small (go early). Room was very clean with free wifi but the shower didn't have much power. Price was good for Switzerland and so will likely stay again. Check in a bit slow as reception is tiny.",5,"2014",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Great location, clean","We booked for the guest house part, and received an upgrade to the hotel part, but no breakfast included. Location is great, close to train station, supermarket, and not far from picturesque old buildings, restaurants, public transport, especially the u-barn. Staff are friendly, courteous and helpful. Room is clean and modern, including the bathroom except the choice of glass door could have been different, as it was difficult not to disturb another person if you want use it in the middle of the night due to the bright light. Towel drying facilities was efficient especially if you want to dry your light washings as well. Overall, we love staying there. There is just one thing, confusion between the guest house and the hotel. Although we booked for the guest house part, the",5,"2014",3
"Hotel_Alexander","Perfect location","This hotel is located in the best best part if the old town, clean, modern. With lift. Free wifi and confortables rooms. A Good breakfast is included. The price is reasonable for Zürich standards. The street is quiet at nights and next to the hotel are a convenient supermarket and some fast food places, bars and restaurants too.",5,"2014",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Great location, perfectly kept rooms, value for money just OK","I warn the reader: our experience of the hotel (and the score given to the cleanliness) is affected by the fact that in front of our door a machine selling drinks was located. Upon our return to the hotel (it was a Saturday night, our room was in a dependance situated on the nearby Zähringerstrasse) we found that someone, after having bought a can of beer, had abandoned it half-full on the ground, overflowing by beer the space in front of our door. The next morning we reported the incident to the reception (also to avoid that we were considered the authors); but the staff has not proven very impressed (possibly often happen?). But let's get to the hotel. I consider that the price paid (109 euro a night for a tiny room twin beds) would be fair (considering that we are in the",4,"2014",3
"Hotel_Alexander","Comfortable, well located hotel","About 10 minutes walk from the main train station and located within the old town of Zurich, we found this hotel to be clean, comfortable and spacious. The staff were friendly and helpful. The room had a universal power adaptor which was really handy - be warned that Swiss power points are not the same as European ones!",4,"2014",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Excellent Hotel Near Central Train Station","I asked Tripadvisor for a reasonable, safe hotel near the Central Train Station in Zurich and I read reviews here. I picked the Hotel Alexander and got exactly what I was looking for in Central Zurich. We could walk and pull our luggage from the train and then walk a couple of blocks and catch public transportation all over this beautiful city. We stayed a night before our tour started and a night after our tour ended. The second nite the hotel was not full so they upgraded us to a larger room that included breakfast at No Extra Cost. The first morning there were rolls and coffee in the lobby if you had not booked a room with breakfast. Will stay there again if I'm ever back in this wonderful city - so many things to see and do.",4,"2014",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Quiet and comfortable","With less than 12 hours to explore Zurich and need to get quality sleep this hotel was perfect. It was very reasonably priced for quality and location. The room I had overlooked a very nice courtyard and was quiet as can be. My flight was very early so I missed breakfast. The staff was helpful and location perfect for exploring old town with many restaurants and shops nearby.",4,"2014",4
"Hotel_Alexander","perfect last minute stay!","We took a quick, spur-of-the-moment trip to Zurich. Considered renting from AirBnB, but after reading Rick Steve's book on Zurich decided to try this hotel and were not disappointed. We requested a quiet room as the hotel is in a trendy bar/shop/cafe area, and it was perfect. New sound-blocking windows, small but cute -and o so clean!- bathroom and a bed I wish I had at home! The free breakfast each day filled us up so we only needed an afternoon treat (after all our walking) and then dinner in the local area (great Italian!!). Hotel is perfectly located so a car is not needed. Bus/train stations are very close as are the Bahnhofstrasse, shops, cafes, etc... Stay here and you will not be disappointed! Great staff too :),,",3,"2014",5

I usually arrive by train and you can conveniently walk from the main station to the hotel within a few minutes. Breakfast only in the hotel, however it is located in Zurich's old town the 'Niederdoerfli and you'll find a variety of bars, restaurants and shops close by. Also the lake, universities and historic sites are within walking distance. Staff are friendly as to expect, and the rooms newly renovated and clean. Fresh fruits and a 'good night chocolate' on your pillow make you feel welcome. All in all, good value for a top location in the heart of the city. For my friends from Asia: if you prefer a spacious atmosphere, you may need to go somewhere else. The lobby and rooms are small but",3,"2014",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Great value for money and central location","My mother and I stayed at the Alexander Hotel for one night in March during our trip to Zürich. The location was perfect: just five minutes from the central station in the heart of the Old Town, within walking distance from some of the nicest shops, cafés and restaurants. It is very close to the Storchen area and to Banhofstrasse, where most of the boutiques are. The check-in process was very smooth, and the lady who welcomed us was extremely kind. We had made a reservation for a business room, without stating a preference on whether we wanted a twin or a double bedded room. The lady at the reception desk suggested that we get the double bedded room because it was bigger and more comfortable. In fact our room (201) was big and cozy. Our room must have been recently renovated",3,"2014",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Small but great location and modern rooms","I had a great time staying in this small but perfectly situated hotel. The rooms have been perfectly renovated and although small they are well appointed. The noise from the pedestrian street can be a bit annoying at night but it didn't bother me too much. No restaurant on site for dinner but it's right in the middle of everything so dinner choices are plentiful.",3,"2014",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Great location and service","This place is within a few walking minutes of Zurich's central train station. It is in the heart of the historical center of town. Lots of restaurants and bars within walking distance. Can""t beat the location. The hotel staff is very friendly and helpfull. My room was spotless, the bathroom recently renovated, and remarkably quiet although being on one of the most ""touristy"" streets of Zurich. A nice touch are the welcome drinks and fruits in the room. The bed is comfortable, the TV channel selection has something for everybody in multiple languages... Breakfast is alright, but a bit pricy; with what they charge for breakfast, one could expect more warm food options.",3,"2014",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Great price for a really nice hotel!","My husband and I stayed in Zurich for one night on Christmas Eve 2013. We arrived in Zurich around 11am and went to the hotel hoping to just drop our bags, but our room was available. YAY! This room was SO NICE! The hotel was very reasonably priced for a city that's so expensive. It was one of the most expensive hotels on our entire trip, but for Zurich, it was a great deal. Very clean and modern! We really enjoyed staying here and would definitely stay here again if we're ever back in Zurich! The breakfast was GREAT and all staff was very kind and accommodating!",2,"2014",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Super Zurich value and option","The hotel is given five stars within the context of its location and pricing. This is a relatively basic no frills hotel, but came at a great rate in an expensive city. The hotel is very well located in the heart of the Old Town, just a few minutes' walk from the station. Staff were friendly and welcoming. Double room was of a decent size, as was the en suite bathroom. Very clean. Free wifi throughout the hotel, and nice touches of complimentary water and apples in the room. Given the price, the breakfast exceeded expectations - a full continental range, not just pastries.",2,"2014",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Well worth it","Stayed here just for a night - wish I'd found it last time I was in Zurich. Good location, good price - fairly small room but it was only to sleep in.

Parking spaces are an adventure :-) The location is very good, right in the center, everything in walking distance. The hotel feels a little bit cold though, it is not very personal.

As it is a car free area, the hotel is very quiet (in addition there are sound proof windows). The hotel is located on one of the best street in the town.

We had booked into the Guest House but were fortunate enough to be upgraded to the hotel. Rooms are small but this wasn't an issue for us as we were out and about all day anyway. Bathroom was small and compact but very clean and modern. WiFi is available free of charge and staff were very helpful and friendly. The hotel (and the guesthouse) are an easy walk from the train station and are located in amongst the old town and many restaurants. Bahnhofstrasse is also an easy walk. On the downside, the pillows were awful and there were no alternatives available. Also, Saturday night was very noisy with (drunk?) men hanging around outside various bars in the street below.",1,"2014",4
"Hotel_Alexander","5 minutes walk from train station","This hotel we book it in the last minute and was a surprise that was so close to all main places in Zürich. I think the rooms were recent renovated because they look like new. Normally for the price you pay you would expect a bigger room, but what I understood, for Zürich hotel style this is standard. Slept very good in the big bed and was very confortable for me and my husband. We are thin people so had no problems with the space. Breakfast was very good and well suplied.",1,"2014",4

It's an easy walk from the station, but it's also readily accessible by tram (#4 from in front of the station to the second stop over the river, Zürich, Rudolf-Brun-Brücke). The hotel's not large, and the rooms are quite simple with modern timber furniture, good heating and cooling and a small desk. There's a small lift, and the staff were wonderful, offering tourist advice and making a dinner reservation when we elected to travel further than the many places outside the front door.

In the end, the room itself was nice, service OK, breakfast and location good. But the extra 50chf cost was not welcome!",11,"2013",3
"Hotel_Alexander","Good basic hotel in Zurich, good service","Location was a 10 to 15 minute walk from the train station across some cobbled streets in the old part of town. The room & bathroom although basic & small, were very clean. Reception staff appeared friendly & accommodating. Breakfast was in a cute little room & had a good range, starting about 6:30 which was good timing. The tv had English speaking channels which sadly thrilled me, what can I say, not entertainment as such but I was able to watch some shows late at night on BBC2 or something like that. We liked that there was an inbuilt power point system in the wall which had various country types including Australia/Asia for us, great thinking. Airport transfer shuttle was convenient & reliable in the morning. It sadly was a little noisy at night with street noise drifting in.",11,"2013",3

The bathroom is very well-equipped but are quite small .Sound-proof windows really kept out the noise from outside. The internet worked very well and buffet breakfast was very good. Staff were friendly and obliging.Great location,in the old town,near many cafes and restaurants.and only a 10 minute walk to the main train station. Zurich is expensive, so you need to expect this.This area is a safe, and lively part of Zurich.",11,"2013",4

"Hotel_Alexander","Value for money!!","It was a comfortable, economical 3 day stay at Alexander. At the price we paid, we got a lot in return. The staff was very warm and welcoming. They strived to make our stay comfortable. It really felt like home during our stay, thanks to the hardworking staff. The hotel has a very homely, welcoming ambiance and one doesn’t feel out of place here. Also the food is great too. It was a pleasant stay, totally value for money. They really understand the meaning of customer satisfaction. We loved this place and would want to visit it again.",10,"2013",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Cozy comfort on one of Zurich's hottest neighborhoods","We were there for 2 nights. About a 5-block walk from the train station. A little tough to find. Small reception area but the staff was friendly and accommodating. 'Cozy' elevator. Room was rather small (about 15' X 15')but clean and comfortable and set back about 10' from the hallway. Bathroom looked like it had been remodeled. GREAT location, a little pricey but the bed was very comfortable. The room safe wasn't working but they sent up staff the next morning and had it fixed (battery). Didn't really hear any noise from other guests and the hotel was pretty full. The flooring was a 'floated' wood so people below wouldn't hear us walking, a very nice amenity! 32"" wall-mounted TV had about 50 stations available. Overall very nice and very efficient.

"Hotel_Alexander","Booked 8 months in advance and was STILL given a room with no Air-conditioning during a heatwave!! VERY disappointed","After spending many, many hours on-line to try and find the absolute best value for money hotel in very expensive Zurich we chose the Hotel Alexander. We were very disappointed to arrive, hot and bothered in the midst of the early August heatwave only to be laughingly told that we had a choice of 1) the room without air-conditioning, or 2) the room where the air-conditioner was broken. We booked in December of 2012 and provided all necessary credit card details etc. to ensure our space, yet the hotel could not provide an air-conditioned room even with 8 months notice. - The person at reception did not seem in any way concerned and found the situation amusing! -- We did not.... It was UNBELIEVABLY HOT and neither my husband nor I slept well at all. - THIS BEING SAID> IF you",10,"2013",3
"Hotel_Alexander","Perfect location, hassle free stay","Our original booking was for the guest house which is cheaper than the hotel, however when we arrived we were told that we had been upgraded and would be staying at this hotel for the same price. The location is perfect, walking distance from the main train station and spitting distance from the main sights of Zurich. The reception staff were very welcoming from the start and the porter took our luggage to our room as we checked in. My husband was unwell and the same porter was very helpful in providing us with extra blankets. We only had 24 hours in Zurich so wanted to squeeze in as much sight seeing as possible. The young lady with the dark hair and glasses at reception was extremely helpful with advising us what we should do, times of local tours, boat trips etc. and provided",10,"2013",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Super Comfortable!!!!!!","We Loved out room- cozy and quiet--we had asked for a quiet room and were placed facing the back of the hotel--super duper--slept like a baby!!!!! loved the room, updated-very nice-had everything we needed. The breakfast room was very nice, good selection of breakfast items, staff were as friendly as can be--plus there is a gelato shop right next door to the hotel--yummy!!!!! situated in the old town, can walk to Everything, the trams run every few minutes-train station only a few blocks away--- really enjoyed our stay here*****",10,"2013",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Wish we'd stayed longer","We only stayed one night in this hotel, but it was very comfortable and most enjoyable as far as hotels go.

Very conveniently located in the old part of Zurich, amongst plenty of eateries and entertainment. Good breakfast. Good internet in the room. For the 3 Star rating and for the price we paid our room was far too small and been given two separate single beds for a matured couple, even we booked 5 months ahead.",10,"2013",3
"Hotel_Alexander","Basic but well located","Rooms are specious enough and clean and air-condition works well. A main advantage of this hotel is its good location - only15 minutes on foot to a railway station. From there - everywhere in Swiss, including 12 minutes to (or from) Zurich Airport. Hotel is located on a pedestrian street, but on its end. So, if you want to use a Taxi, it can stop in 20 meters from hotel's doors on Muhlegasse street. Hotel is not too expensive, taking into consideration crazy prices in Swiss and in particular in Zurich.",10,"2013",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Great people.","We enjoyed our stay a lot.we also got room upgrade.staff was amazing.rooms are excellent.couldnt ask for more.area is near to the train station,which was very convenient.

During morning hours you can prepare coffee in the lobby. If will be visiting Zurich in the future, will choose this hotel again.",9,"2013",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Wonderful Stay at Hotel Alexander In Zurich","I always stay at the Hotel Alexander in Zurich and each time it gets better and better! Firstly its location is superb near the railway station and in the old town where the eateries are just fabulous. One can spend hours exploring the old town with its winding cobbled streets and lovely restaurants. A short walk brings you to the riverside and one can have a beautiful walk alongside it. Also a short distance away is Bahnofstrasse where one can happily window shop or actually shop depending on one's inclination and of course finances! The best part of the Hotel is the fantastic service one gets. The staff are so helpful and always smiling. Nothing is impossible for them! The breakfast is great and the rooms are spotless and really comfortable. There is free wi fi access and",9,"2013",5

And the service was excellent. Definitely,would stay there again and recommend to others.",9,"2013",5
"Hotel_Alexander","GOOD LOCATION","there is nothing bad to say about.

Room are not very big, but fresh and cosy.",9,"2013",4

"Hotel_Alexander","well...","On the 08 of April 2013 we booked a double bed room at the hotel Alexander for three nights at the end of August. On our arrival to the hotel on the 22 of August we were told that our room was not available , as it was given to another couple, arrived before us. We had to accept a room with two separate beds. And.. the room was small - really SMALL. We booked this hotel as we read someone's comments on this website that the rooms were big. It is not true, the rooms are SMALL. For the price we paid we would expect something much bigger and better. There was no body lotion or toothpaste in the bathroom, no glasses or cups in the room to drink water from. Very, very basic. Overpriced. Try to find something else.",8,"2013",2
"Hotel_Alexander","Nice place in the heart of Zurich!","We stayed here in January. Rooms are big, clean, cosy, comfortable. Wifi was free and worked great in our room as well. The hotel in just a few steps from the river and in the center of this beautiful city. Near the hotel is a shopping market that worked late and many nice restaurants. You can be on foot and see Zurich in the best way possible.",8,"2013",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Felt like a home from home.","I stayed for 5 days in July and it was great. The room was newly modernised and very clean and tastefully decorated. 2 single beds, ensuite shower, fridge, safe, UK sockets! Having air conditioning was great, a real blessing in the hot summer. Free wifi was great. Location is so central, really handy for everything. I thought it was very reasonably priced. Room totally quiet. Breakfast was very good (Note - get some Earl Grey tea for us British!). The man on the front desk was so helpful (even late at night) printing out maps and translating things. All in all, if I visit Zurich again (which I will as it is beautiful), I will be heading straight back to this hotel again.",8,"2013",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Modern room, Well clean, Good Breakfast","And that's it. Nothing fancy about this hotel but it's a good B&B at a decent price for Zurich and it has Air Conditioned which is not so easy to find in Zurich. Room is comfortable, and spacious with a good bathroom. The location is also excellent near the river/lake and with lots of restaurants and terraces specialty in the summer.",8,"2013",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Some pros, one major disappointment","Just returned from a stay in Zurich. I had booked a family room for our stay (3 of us) and had requested an air conditioned room. Pros - great location. Room had many things in its favour - good size, lots of luggage storage, safe, fridge, power sockets etc. Walking distance to all the major attractions. Good breakfast. Cons - I had chosen this hotel based on the fact that they advertised as having air conditioning. Supposedly our room had air conditioning - I don't think so! Our room had a ""Klima"" switch with three settings - all of which emitted a puff of air, or as someone at the front desk described it when I called to see if it needed to be fixed, ""a gentle flow of air"". At best it changed the temperature in the room by a fraction of a degree - the room was hot! We",8,"2013",2
"Hotel_Alexander","Surprising little gem in the middle of town","Right smack in the middle of old town. Fantastic location. Clean, spacious room. Friendly and helpful staff. For what it cost this is a total surprise and delight. They even have power sockets from around the world so no worries if you forget to bring an adaptor! Walking distance to everywhere and supermarket close by for some cheap food. Some rather nice traditional Swiss restaurants nearby too. Highly recommended.",8,"2013",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Fantastic location","The Hotel Alexander is in a fantastic location, in the old town yet 5 mins from the train station and within walking distance of all the downtown attractions, business district etc. Staff are helpful and friendly. The rooms are clean and well-equipped, with little touches like international sockets. Plenty of storage space and shutters to darken the room properly. Good breakfast.",7,"2013",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Don't Stay Here","I rented three rooms for one night at the Hotel Alexander. This was the end of our stay in Switzerland and we wanted to be close to the airport for our flight home. On the surface our rooms looked just fine but as we climbed into bed we found blood on our sheets in two of our three rooms. My daughters bed had blood on the duvet and our bed had blood on the pillows. The staff changed my daughters duvet but we just slept without pillows. When I told the front desk about this in the morning they we rude and abrupt. They questioned how much blood...really, does it even matter how much blood, any blood is too much. The area is seedy especially at night, I would be careful with small children out at night because of the surrounding stripper bars. three rooms for one night cost",7,"2013",1
"Hotel_Alexander","great location, friendly service","Zurich is an insanely expensive city and I admit I chose on price. Given the good location, I was potentially expecting a run down slightly daggy hotel. I was totally wrong! The service was excellent and when I contacted them to let them know I would arrive very late due to missed flights etc, they replied quickly (maybe half and hour!!) telling me this was no problem and upgrading me from the Guesthouse to the main hotel for my troubles. This made my life much easier given the hour. The breakfast was excellent, just what I needed for my big day ahead. It was no problem to leave my luggage there for the day and they even had a little ticket system to ensure no-one else could take it. It was still pretty pricey but everything in Zurich is, so relatively speaking it was pretty",7,"2013",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Great overnight stay","My husband & I stayed at Hotel Alexander in June for 1 night on our way to Paris. The room was a good size & very modern, brd was also very comfortable.

"Hotel_Alexander","A good choice in the centre of Zurich","We were pleasantly surprised with this choice of hotel. The hotel is a leisurely 10 minute walk from the Zurich HB. The rooms were very clean and made good use of the space provided. The bathroom was spotless and again the utilisation of space was very good. As we arrived early in the morning, having just arrived from our long connecting flight from Australia, we were offered breakfast as our room was not yet available due to the hotel being booked out the night before. The breakfast buffet includes the normal continental fare that is regularly topped up by the ever efficient waitresses. Scrambled eggs are available for those who wish to have something warm for breakfast. Bahnhofstrasse is a short walk away for those who want to do some window shopping. We saved CHF15 per",7,"2013",4

Our room overlooked a street but it was quiet. Complimentary breakfast was excellent. We would stay at this hotel again.",7,"2013",5
"Hotel_Alexander","An excellent over night stop","We booked in advance into the Alexander Guesthouse which is across the road from the hotel. On arrival, wet, cold and a bit tired we were upgraded to the hotel. The room was modern, had everything we needed. Chocolate on the pillow, two bottles of water and two eating apples! The staff were very friendly and helpful, the breakfast was excellent. We had selected this location as it was only ten minutes walk from the railway station, so easy access back to the airport. Despite being in the busy centre of the city the room was entirely sound proof. We requested extra pillows and these were delivered immediately. An excellent location for exploration of the city, the old town and down to the lake. Plenty of choice of restaurants. We returned a fortnight later only to be",6,"2013",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Great location","We booked three rooms for our last night in Switzerland. The close proximity of the hotel to the train station made it an ideal choice. The pedestrian-only street was filled with cafes and shops which made a fun atmosphere. It is close to all the places we wanted to walk on our brief visit to Zurich. The rooms were recently renovated, were very clean and had good lighting. The included breakfast was good, and the freshly made scrambled eggs were especially delicious. We highly recommend this hotel as a great value.",6,"2013",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Convenient & Good","This hotel is ideal for a comfortable, clean base in Zurich. The railway station is only 10 minutes away. There are plentiful eating places right outside in the street which is a colourful and interesting location to be in. Facilities were good, and the bed very comfortable, staff helpful. All you could want.",6,"2013",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Good hotel with good location","We have stayed in a newly renovated double room, which is clean, cosy and bright. They even provided us an electric kettle for boiling water. The only to complaint is the shower water is a bit weak. The counter staff are very friendly and helpful. The location of the hotel is good and convenient with many restaurants nearby. Tram bus no. 4 run to and fro train station every 7 minutes to the stop Rudolf-Brun-Brucke in 2 minutes, which is just a minute away from the hotel. This has made our trip with baggage more convenient and easy. And save us lots of time and energy every time we travel with train. And it is valid with Swiss pass.",6,"2013",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Nice place for the night","This place was close to the train station. We got there early, (overnight flight from the US). The front desk lady was so nice, and booked a tour of Zurich for us. We left our luggage, had complimentary coffee and a piece of fruit before we went out and explored. (This was great, because every thing is expensive in Zurich.) When we came back to check in, they upgraded us the the main hotel which included free breakfast. The breakfast was plentiful and fantastic. We ate fondue that night in the bar next to the hotel- and if you show your room card holder, you get 5 CHF off. The place is centrally located in a great walking area. We had faced the street, but because it was rainy, it wasn't really noisy. I would suggest ear plugs and eye shades, just in case. Overall, a",6,"2013",4

"Hotel_Alexander","Maybe it was because this was the last day of the trip","Maybe I was tired because ot was the last day of my trip, but this place bothered me. Their driving directions were not so good – fortunately my gps proved reliable. It was very expensive, but not that great of a room – no AC, for one thing (make sure to ask for it – some rooms have it). The windows open on a loading dock for a supermarket! The driver blew the horn at about 6:30am! The block has two nudie bars on it. The whole city (including the confusing high-rise airport) felt like it was designed to sell you something at double the normal price. For instance, the pizza place across from the hotel charged 4 euros to give us two plates for the one pizza we ordered to share and, of course, charged 2 euros for water -- a 23 euro pizza for 29 euros. That got old fast. In the",6,"2013",3
"Hotel_Alexander","A very nice hotel in an excellent location near Zurich HB","My colleagues and I are visiting Zurich for business every few weeks. We chose Alexander to be our hotel in Zurich because it's a great combination of lovely small hotel, personal service, for reasonable pricing for Zurich and great location of 5 min to Zurich main station. In addition even the single rooms are specious (well, not to golf but clearly to move around :) ) and the breakfast is good and also vegeis have enough options to enjoy it.",5,"2013",5

We returned to the Alexander in January & it was nice to be welcomed by the staff asking after my health. It was lovely to be treated unobtrusively & made to feel that nothing was a bother, would definitely stay at the Alexander if we return to Zurich.

Good value for money and reception staff were always happy to help.",1,"2013",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Great location and nice room","The hotel is about a 10-minute walk from the train station in the Old Town area of Zurich. It's on a pedestrian-only street with restaurants, bars and shops. Not to mention the Christkindlmarkts set up nearby. I walked everywhere I went and it didn't seem unreasonably far to anything. The furthest I went was to Lake Zurich, which was probably 20 minutes. The room itself was a little bit small, made more so by the fact I was on the top floor and the room had slanted ceilings. If I had traveled with another person, getting into bed on that side of the room would've been a little difficult. I thought the bathroom was a good size. With wi-fi and breakfast included in the price of the room, I thought this was an excellent value. Especially considering how expensive a lot of other",12,"2012",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Excellent location, small rooms","The location was perfect, as the hotel was close to station and city shopping. You could find lots of restaurants, bars and shops nearby. The room was a bit small, and the bathroom was even smaller than an average bathroom. Furthermore, there were no toiletries (apart from liquid soap). However the room was clean, and despite the low temperatures, warm. The only issue was that the room pirce was too high (you would expect a 5 star hotel) but all hotels in Zurich are expensive. The free wi-fi is a plus. The service was excellent.",12,"2012",4

Zurich is an expensive city, and this was the best deal I could find, and well worth it. The hotel is also in a great location for tourists.",12,"2012",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Great Location in Old Town Zurich - Close to Train Station","I actually stayed at Hotel Alexander twice and would recommend the hotel. It is small but the price was right for Zurich and I do not spend much time in the hotel rooms anyways, so it was ok for me. The hotel is a short 10 minutes or less walk from the train station which is about a 15 minute train ride from the Airport. I have no issues with a large suite case with wheels walking to the hotel. Upon my first stay, I was very grateful that I was able to have an early check-in after an overnight flight from US. It made a big difference being able to settle down and shower before off sightseeing in the morning. The breakfast room is small, but I was always up at 7 am, so I had no issues. My first visit, my room faced the courtyard which was quiet. The 2nd visit, my room",12,"2012",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Proximity & atmosphere","I often make weekend trips and arrived somewhere on a Friday evening or walked my feet off all day on a Sat or Sun - which means I usually want room service. The Alexander doesn't have this but, located in the heart of the old town, it is surrounded by restaurants and bars so its not really a problem. It is also within walking distance of virtually anywhere you'd like to see ... especially for a weekend break but if there for longer I believe it would still be fine. The rooms are a little tight on space - which could be an issue if there for a long time but more than adequate for a few days - and have been renovated to a modern and comfortable standard. The breakfast room is small so I wouldn't risk being in a rush in case you have to wait for a table but as long as you'll low",11,"2012",4
"Hotel_Alexander","A weekend in Zurich","My husband and I decided to spend the weekend in Zurich and after trawling through the list of hotels in Tripadvisor, we thought the Hotel Alexander offered a good location at a good price. We were not disappointed. The room was a bit small but perfectly good for 2 people, and more importantly it and the bathroom were spotlessly clean. The hotel staff were very helpful (particularly in organising the return of a phone recharger we left behind) and the hotel is very centrally located, being a short and pleasant walk to Fraumunster, Bharnhoffstrasse and the Kunsthause Museum. The only small drawback is that the breakfast room is small for the number of rooms in the hotel so you may have a small wait to be seated for breakfast. Having said that, the ladies working in the breakfast",11,"2012",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Great reception staff","We came into town a night earlier than our reservation at Alexander's Guesthouse. Both the hotel and the guesthouse were full. One of the women at the front desk, not only called three or four nearby hotels to find us a reservation, she escorted us down the street to the hotel! The next night we stayed at Alexander Guesthouse, a very good choice, and I'd certainly stay at the Hotel Alexander after being treated like that.",11,"2012",4
"Hotel_Alexander","A family run hotel in a world of faceless chains","It was a pleasure staying at this small family owned hotel in the heart of old Zurich. A short walk from the train station and right in the middle of the old town, everywhere was in easy walking distance. I had a very quiet room with a comfortable bed and newly refurbished shower room overlooking a pretty courtyard (see photograph). The breakfast buffet was excellent for a hotel in this price range with a friendly woman who prepared freshly cooked breakfasts to order. Very good value for a 3star hotel. - I would highly recommend it.",11,"2012",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Convenient and sufficient","We stayed here for 1 night only (as this was just a stop leading to another destination). It was very near to all the places we needed to hit, given we only have a day (the train station is walking distance, restaurants, Bahnhofstrasse). Our room was on the second floor yet we did not experience the noise other people complained about (or maybe we were just too tired). The free water was a nice touch (we didn't get that in our hotel in Paris). The room and bathroom was clean, decent and for the price we paid i think it is sufficient (given that it is Zurich).",11,"2012",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Very good business hotel","The hotel is in the middle of the Altstadt, surrounded by restaurants and similar, yet the rooms are quiet. Reasonable size room with very good facilities. Service was courteous and friendly, Breakfast was OK but could have greater v ariety of food. The price is reasonable for central Zurich, 7 minutes walking from the Hauptbahnhof, less than 5 minutes from the central tram location and 15-20 minutes walk to the business section of town.",9,"2012",4

It is also close to the main shopping tram line Bahnhofstrasse. Friendly and helpful service staffs, Breakfast is though decent and sufficient but limited. The only downside is that it can get get noisy at night as it is situated in the bar and restaurant area as well as next to the supermarket where stocks delivery during early morning with noises coming from the delivery truck can be very annoying. The truck is normally parked on a small dead end street between the hotel and the supermarket. Given this is a small hotel, unfortunately all the rooms are either located facing the bars and restaurants",9,"2012",3
"Hotel_Alexander","You get what you pay for","Stayed one night in September 2012 with my wife before a flight back to the US. We stayed in the lowest possible cost room (room 314). Overall, this is a pretty standard ""holiday inn"" level hotel. For ~$180/night, you get a clean room, a decent bathroom, and breakfast. If I was on a quick business trip, this would not be a bad hotel. There is a food right outside the hotel open 24/7 and it is close to the city center. If you are vacationing, I would find another hotel. A few items worth noting: (1) Room does NOT have air conditioning. There are no A/C vents in the room. There is a portable, glorified fan that you can use however. I see this as false advertising. We found the room to fairly warm and, at a minimum, needed some more air flow.

"Hotel_Alexander","Modern hotel and close to restaurants","We stayed in Hotel Alexander for on a Saturday night during August. The location is in the old town of Zurich and within 15min walk from the Central train station. Many of the attractions are within walking distance and plenty of restaurants and bars nearby. The hotel is modern, the rooms are clean and the reception staff helpful. However there are minor downsides, which include: - Flaky Internet connection. Requires a unique activation key for each device. Also, each time you disconnect for a period of time (i.e. an hour or more), you will require a new activation key. Not a big deal but can be a hassle should you wish to use the Internet at different times of the day and if you have multiple devices. - Can be noisy on a Saturday night. We stayed on the second level and could",9,"2012",3
"Hotel_Alexander","Nice","Nice room, clean and confy. Customer Service wasnt so good. I asked an information about the bill and the person at the reception was touchy and snappy. A part frm that it was a good esperience. Very central, as you walk out you are in the heart of zurich.",8,"2012",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Good Value for Money and Friendly staff!","I went for a business trip in a few weeks back, the hotel is newly renovated with very comfortable bed, it is in a very central location, short walk from Zurich Bhan and right in the old town with many restaurant choices, there is also a grocery store around the corner from the hotel. it is overall great value for money, the only disappointment was the breakfast, you will be better off getting something from local bakery or coffee house. Staff is very friendly. Kristy was at the front desk when i checked in, she recommended a restaurant for dinner and even order for me (the waitress didnt speak much English). i will stay here again!",8,"2012",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Attractive hotel, great location, great city","The recently renovated Alexander has a lot going for it. It's in a great area, only a few minutes' walk from the Central Station, the river and the lake. The streets outside are lively, day and night, but there were no noise problems in my room. My room was ultramodern, sleek and comfortable. I loved the room's simple, bright, minimalist style, the crisp linens, the super cleanliness. The bathroom was excellent. I appreciated inclusions such as the continuous power supply with power sockets for UK, French/German, and Chinese/Australian plugs. Breakfast was just what I was looking for, and the staff, in the breakfast room and in reception, were welcoming and helpful. The room rate, booked on the hotel's website, represented fine value in a very expensive city.",8,"2012",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Love the location, love the new look...","... and a special thanks to the the friendly and helpful staff - from the first moment we arrived to the moment we had to leave! Happy to rest in a clean modern and air conditioned room - even more so after a rather bumpy ride on a night train... Could have stayed in the room all day - yet the great location, the river and lake nearby beckoned - and all amenities so conveniently located. First had concerns about possibly noise disturbance (Niederdorf), however no problems whatsoever - and yes, we will stay again at ""The Alexander"" on our next whirlwind trip to Zurich!!",7,"2012",5
"Hotel_Alexander","good hotel...good location","The hotel is a cozy little hotel ,located near the main station about 5 minutes walk from the Main station. The Street itself is a happening place with lot of cafes and restaurants ,shops .One of the famous lane of Zurich, The checkin was a breeze and rooms are ultra modern and new renovated rooms which was classy .But the room was bit small for the price you pay .Though comfortable . The breakfast on the second floor in a small restaurant is very basic and lacks choice . overall enjoyed the place .",7,"2012",4
"Hotel_Alexander","The little hotel that could...","...from the fresh apples, a refrigerator, and free bottled water in the rooms to Nespresso cafe and croissants offered ""on the go"" at the main entrance for busy tourist and businessmen who do not have time for their traditional breakfasts. This newly renovated hotel is located in the perfect spot to reach trams, the shopping district, the lake and the Hauptbahnhof (HB) aka main train station. Tram 4 is 20 feet away and only takes 2 mins to the HB that can take you to the ZRH airport in about 10-15 mins.. Very convenient, friendly and the multi-lingual staff is very pleasant. Be sure to purchase tram/train ticket for the airport at the Reception desk. Also if you are loaded with luggage, there is a service that will take you to the airport directly (CHF 40) but they need as",7,"2012",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Modern Hotel and Superb Location","We have visited Zurich many times in the past and stayed at various hotels. We were first worried as we saw the small, narrow entrance and a small reception desk. But our opinion changed from the time we started our interaction with the hotel staff. They were very friendly and efficient, looked genuinely happy to have us. It seemed as though the hotel had been renovated, the paint fresh, with modern amenities, clean and stylish. As for the location, it was perfect with the neighbourhood packed with cafe's, restaurants and lot of shopping. We would definitely stay there when we visit Zurich again and would recommend this compact, stylish hotel to anyone.",7,"2012",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Small, modern and in the middle of Zurich","Over the past couple of years, I have travelled to Zurich on business about 4 times each year. I've been rotating throughout the various moderate-price, small hotels. Hotel Alexander has recently been modernized. All the rooms have a clean modern look, with nice lighting accents. The beds and bedding are comfortable and the bathrooms very clean. OK, two people cannot share the bathroom at the same time, unless they want to be very friendly. The hotel staff are friendly and helpful. They provide free WIFI access. The included breakfast buffet is your basic European fare. The price depends on the time of the year, but even in the middle of the summer a room is about 200 francs, which is good value for Zurich. A small Migros food stare is next door and you're surrounded by all",7,"2012",4

"Hotel_Alexander","Excellent hotel, great location","This hotel is great - just a few minutes' stumble from the train station, on a cobbled pedestrian street which is packed with restaurants. The rooms look very new and modern, as if they've been refurbished recently, and the bathrooms are absolutely sparkling. The beds are comfortable with nice sheets. The staff are pleasant and the rates include both wi-fi and breakfast. The breakfast buffet itself was fine. More than happy to stay here again.",6,"2012",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Alexander the Good","I would go back to this hotel. I would recommend this place to my friends. It was certainly a nice stay. LOCATION (5 stars) This place is in a very good location, where shops and restaurants are abundant and within steps away. It also helps that a grocery store is located next door in case you need some additional food and other supplies. The immediate vicinity is teeming with activities and local sights are within minutes. PARKING (2 stars) Parking is limited. The hotel has a private parking place. However, this involves an extra fee and spaces are not guaranteed. The parking is not within the immediate vicinity of the hotel, but its location is nearby. There is also a public parking garage across the water (Urania), but depending on the day and time of your arrival, you may",5,"2012",4
"Hotel_Alexander","In the heart of Entertainment district","We (2 couples) were suppose to stay in the cheaper ""Guesthouse"" but were upgraded from the ""Guesthouse"" to the Alexander Hotel. Our rooms were very nice, stylish, good beds with comforter, great bath/shower, sound proof windows (kept most of the street noise out. The hotel is in the midst of the entertainment are with many bars and restaurants. Helpful staff got us checked in quickly and helped us with shuttle bus transport to the airport the next morning. Overall a wonderful stay!!",5,"2012",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Good hotel in the city center","It is a good 3star hotel in the city center. Rooms are small but they are recently renovated and they have everything you need. Breakfast is included in the price but is rather moderate. Price is average for Zurich.",5,"2012",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Very central and surprisingly modern","I travel to Zurich quite a lot and tend to stay in different hotels. This is one of the first ones I would like to go back to. 1 major point is the central location, only a short walk to the bahnhof but also in the middle of some nice and cute restaurants. 2nd major point: a modern and clean room with comfortable beds and a modern bathroom and 3rd major point: they thought about the business traveller! 4 different types of plugs at the desk, European, swiss, uk and US. Now converter needed. It is a small detail but very much appreciated. Next to those 3 major points, reception was friendly, there was some mineral water and swiss chocolate complementary to the room and breakfast was nice",5,"2012",4
"Hotel_Alexander","excellent staff & location","Visited Zurich for a day, and even if the room wasn't ready yet, the staff/personel were all very courteous to keep our luggage so we can start walking around. They speak fluent English. I reserved triple room and seeing that I had a taller 16 year old, they offered to give us 2 separate rooms for the price of one. As other reviewers alluded to, water bottles and fruits in the room were even included. The common spots to visit are all within walking distance. The surrounding was very lively and shops are only a few steps away. Very accessible to the main train station too, just a 5 minute walk.",5,"2012",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Ingenious use of ridiculously small space!","As a regular traveler to Europe I've become accustomed to small hotel rooms, but this one wins the prize! The ""big double bed"" is actually slightly smaller than a Queen (made up of 2 beds pushed together which is what you get almost everywhere in real Euro hotels) and at the foot of the bed there was 2 ft of space (less the wall mounted tv) on the window side less than 2'6"" and on the entry door/armoire/table/desk etc side a tad over 3 ft. Now, where to put a suitcase to open it? Only on the bed. But it is uber-modern, cool lighting and decor. Sizewise, the bathroom belongs on a 70's cruiseship (in steerage), but it's also uber-modern, funky fittings and absolutely ingenious use of space. Pity about the terrible water pressure. Breakfast was a stripped down, bare basics",4,"2012",3

The care taking",3,"2012",3
"Hotel_Alexander","Short trip in Zurich","I recently visited Zurich and selected Hotel Alexander by chance. Hotel was very central and I belive one of the best places to stay in Zurich according to price- quality index. Although I had no idea before I went there, I was very impressed after I saw my room. Everthing was in good order and very clean. I also liked the decoration of the room which recently renovated. In the room, you have your own safe, small refrigerator and permanent power supply that allow to charge your battaries even youre not in the room, which is a plus. There were some offers waiting in the room like beverages and swiss chocolate. Also breakfast was good and you can find different sort of cheese. Even hotel is in the center of the city, there was no disturbing sound nearby. And I want to add that",2,"2012",4
"Hotel_Alexander","good location","This Hotel is in a good location. Walking distance to everywhere. 5 min walk to Bahnhoff Strasse and Old Town. Rooms are very clean. Staff is helpful and friendly. Free wi-fi is available and works good. Breakfast is nice and enough. Decoration is average but compare to the price its ok. Nearby there are very nice places for dinner or to have a drink. If you are after a nice room and little more fancy you should stay in a hotel around Bahnhoff Strasse. They have also parking place but you should let them know in advance and its 15 CHF per night. Its in 5 min walking distance.",12,"2011",3
"Hotel_Alexander","Hotel Alexander","I have been several times, including last summer, to Hotel Alexander and I have no hesitation in recommending it to everyone visiting Zuerich. It is very close to the city centre and train station. Rooms are comfortable and staff is friendly 24/7. Most important television sport events are given free. I will be back as soon as I can.",11,"2011",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Good value, clean comfy and central","This hotel is situated near a road, but on the cobbled pedestrian streets in the old town. A Taxi can drop you almost at the door but not quite. The hotel is clean and the rooms look recently decorated. With nice modern bathrooms, good showers and comfy beds. There was also a good selection of English TV channels (BBC1 and 2, ITV 1 and 2 and I think maybe one or two more). Breakfast was simple, but tasty. Zurich is a relatively small place, so no where is far from here. It's quite easy to walk to the Hotel from the Central Station (Zurich HB). Where trains run regularly to and from the airport. I travel a lot on business and it's little hotels like this that make the difference. Not too expensive, clean and comfy.",11,"2011",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Good hotel","We stayed at the ""depandansa"" of the Alexander hotel, which was on the street behind the main hotel. Locaion of the hotel is great, with a good 5 minute walk from the train station. Its position is on a small but busy cobbled street, which has a lot of bars and fast food places and a supermarket just round the corner. The room was really nice, clean, though on a small side. We just missed an actual closet. The wiew was on a street and we had a lovely balcony (2nd floor only!). The staff was accomodating, changed our room without problems and made a double bed out of two twin beds. The beds were comfortable. A minor complaint would be some seedy red light district shops near the hotel. Other than that everything was great and the price was even better.",11,"2011",4
"Hotel_Alexander","good location","the hotel located in the center of city, 10 minutes from train station. Within walking distance of lots of attractions. Very clean and comfortable. Staff is really nice. A lot of restaurants around and nearby. Breakfast is very simple. Hotel is very expensive.",10,"2011",3
"Hotel_Alexander","Good place to saty","Just came back from Zurich.Hotel is situated in old town, close to train station about 7 min away walking.Rooms are very clean with really white sheets on beds. Comfortable pillows and comforter. They don't provide shampoo or conditioner just liquid soup. Staff is really nice and they speak many languages. Ask to stay on a higher floor because below you are clubs and restaurants. People party most of the night. Room are air conditioned but it doesn't get very cold in room. A bit overpriced but I would stay there again. Twin beds 2 or 3 in each room.",9,"2011",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Great place with great staff","The hotel is very clean and comfortable. The location is wonderful. Within walking distance of lots of attractions and the main train station. The staff is great. Our flight home was delayed by a day due to hurricane Irene. The desk staff arranged another night at the hotel, changed our airport shuttle, and verified and printed documentation of our new flights. Katherina and Anthony were especially helpful, but all of the staff were friendly and accommodating. Would recommend this hotel for tourists.",9,"2011",5
"Hotel_Alexander","Average hotel, nicely located, expensive","I stayed at the Hotel Alexander while attending a conference located nearby at ETH Zurich. On the plus side, the hotel is in a good location, not far from the main Zurich train station, surrounded by restaurants, and a short walk to ETH Zurich and to public transit. The rooms are basic but comfortable, and include both free wireless and a basic but good breakfast. The service was also helpful and friendly, although they could get a bit overwhelmed at the front desk if several people needed something at the same time (with only one person behind the desk, I had to wait a couple of times when someone needed something that could not be quickly resolved). My main complaint about the hotel is the cost, specifically the cost to quality ratio. You pay a lot to stay at the hotel, but",8,"2011",3
"Hotel_Alexander","Nice little Hotel in a noisey area","Stayed at the Hotel Alexander for two nights. Really liked the location during the day, as it was convenient to sightseeing, restaurants and shopping. But at night it was VERY loud until all hours. I would have a hard time staying there again because of the noise. Too bad, because the room was nice, with wood floors and a modern bathroom.",7,"2011",3
"Hotel_Alexander","Hotel was nice but location...too many hookers!","This is a nice, clean hotel with a decent breakfast (included) and helpful and friendly staff. But the location of the hotel's annex on Zahringerstrasse is unfortunate. The hotel proper and annex are conveniently located close to the bahnhoff and dozens of eateries, shops, a few steps from the Limmat River and 5 minutes walking distance from the Grossmünster. But there's nothing more disheartening than navigating past the droves of prostitutes at night to get to our room, or wading through the flotsam of spent condoms on the way to breakfast in the main hotel. I have nothing against the profession, but the prevalence of the ladies and their debris paints an otherwise satisfactory hotel experience in a REALLY bad light.",6,"2011",2
"Hotel_Alexander","utterly overpriced","For what it offers this hotel is utterly overpriced (like everything in Zurich - - don’t go unless you must). The room we had for approx. 235 Euro/night had an incredibly small bathroom (even for European standards), no air conditioning, and was extremely noisy even during weekdays (the area wasn’t one for us…bars and striped bars, with people screaming all night long and the store next door starting to unload stuff very early in the morning). Breakfast included was very, very basic. (Just as a side for 195 Euro/night, we stayed in the same trip in Milan at Principe Di Savoy, a truly luxury five star hotel). My plan is to ask for some money back.",6,"2011",2
"Hotel_Alexander","Okay hotel","Average hotel - not in the nice part of town - near red light district. But clean, convenient. The price is not cheap, but reasonable in Zurich.",5,"2011",3
"Hotel_Alexander","Great Location...service lets them down","The staff do what they have to but are not very friendly or helpful, I asked for assistance in making a phone call home to family and they wouldn't help me Location is suberb, however the room is very basic but larger than a lot 3 star hotels in Europe. Hotel staff communiction is very poor as well bit of an attitude issue I think which was a shame because it ticks all other boxes",1,"2011",3
"Hotel_Alexander","Best value in Zurich","We booked a room in their guesthouse, but were offered a room in the main hotel because they were full. Since everything is so expensive in Zurich, this was the most reasonable hotel for us. Heater in the room was poor and the air register vent could not be turned off, hence cold air blowing 24/7. We were told by the hotel staff that there was nothing that could be done, so we shoved newspapers into the vent to block the draft. There's a refrigerator in the room; laptop with free internet in the lobby.",12,"2010",3
"Hotel_Alexander","No frills, but great location","If you want a nice room or good service, look elsewhere. If you don't mind that the TV doesn't work and the front desk is not very helpful with anything, this place has a good enough location to make it worth the price (remember, every hotel in Zurich is overpriced). Easy walk from the main train station, even with luggage.",11,"2010",3
"Hotel_Alexander","A weekend break","This hotel was absolutely perfect for our weekend break in Zurich. The location could not be much more central and there are loads of lovely restaurants close by. Our room was on the 4th floor so any noice coming from the street did not bother us at all. Room was clean and had two windows facing the street. The breakfast was very sufficient had everything I needed. Overall we had a really nice stay here and I could definitely come back!",11,"2010",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Truly overpriced","The hotel is actually decent, but the price is way over what it should be for this type of quality. The room was ok but kind of dark and the design is definitely not as nice as shown on the website of the hotel. Inside it is a mix of 70s design (which could theoretically give it a touch, but doesn't) with some modern stuff. Generally old looking stuff inside. Breakfast poor and disorganised. The breakfast room is way too small for the number of people wanting to seat and the personnel is overwhelmed. We took the (expensive) parking of the hotel and it is not to be recommended. The parking is not at the hotel, but a few hundreds meters away and you can't just get in like this. You have to pass by the hotel, get the remote control, then drive back to the parking, park your car,",10,"2010",2
"Hotel_Alexander","Just okay but great location","The hotel is simply OK. The rooms are clean but extremely small and the hotel its self is just small and nothing exciting to look at. However, the location is excellent. I think Hotel Adler or Hotel Wellenberg would be a better pick and it is literally just down the road. I would not stay here again as I saw more updated hotels in the area for the same price once I was there.",10,"2010",3
"Hotel_Alexander","Great Location Easy To Find....... Poor Value For Money","Having said poor value for money this is Switzerand & everything is very expensive. We paid 150 swiss francs for 1 night in a twin room (approx £100 per room) but we did leave it very late to look for a room. Easy to find from main Zurich train station >>>>> out of main entrance of station, left at large co op building, cross bridge over the river & in front off you is a Starbucks, turn right here & the hotel is situated in this road on the left hand side (on a corner), past Big Ben Bar, Calypso Night Club, Bernies Clothes Shop & Jack Jones Clothes Shop You can get a number 4 tram but its a waste of time as its easy to walk (5-8 mins tops) Rooms are pretty basic but the location is ideal",9,"2010",3
"Hotel_Alexander","Great Location, Great Value for Zurich","I searched on-line for a hotel in Zurich for weeks and simply required a great location, air conditioning, private bath (you'd be surprised...), free breakfast, free internet, and an acceptable price. Considering how expensive all of the hotels were, I really wanted the free breakfast and internet. Both were great. The hotel is tiny by American standards. The rooms are also small, but adequate. The bathrooms are clean and modern. The bed was firm, but the bedding was very comfortable. The staff was always available, kind, and very helpful. The location was wonderful with a grocery store and pharmacy next door and dozens of restaurants to chose from with lots of people watching opportunities. Be prepared for how ridiculously expensive eating out is. Our room had a mini",8,"2010",3

"Hotel_Alexander","Fine for one night in Zurich","We stayed here on our arrival from the US on a Wednesday night and our very small room was in a quiet part of the main hotel so we did not hear street noise. The bathroom and beds were just fine. I've rated it low on value as I'm comparing it to other places we stayed in Milan, Florence, and Interlaken where the prices were lower and the accommodations and included breakfast were better. It was an easy 15 minute walk from the train station (we almost 70 years old), excellent location for seeing the old town and Zurich's wonderful Kunst Museum (Art).",8,"2010",3

Would suggest adding a hairdryer to the guesthause rooms.",7,"2010",4

"Hotel_Alexander","Great Location - Convenient & Comfortable short stay","The location is the best feature.... its has all the trams connections within reach. Its about 5-7 minutes from the main railway station and very close to main shopping street. The hotel is situated in a lane full of different bars and restaurants... We were there during the FIFA cup and really enjoyed it. The room though a tad small is very comfortable & Clean. Also we found most hotels in Zurich steeply priced. Alexander is well priced comparatively.",7,"2010",3
"Hotel_Alexander","BEWARE OF ROOM 108","Location of this hotel is ideal for being in the centre of Zurich and only 5 minutes walk from station. It is also in a street full of bars with music which is ideal if you want that sort of thing, but no good for an early night if you have been travelling all day. Although I was given room 108 I did ask if this was a quiet room and was told at reception ""I hope so"". As it turns out this room and 109 are directly next to a bar had loud music playing until 2am. I did make a representation to the night porter at 11.15 pm and his only response was "" well what do you expect, this is a city and it is saturday night and so people want to enjoy themselves"". No apology or anything. Not at all satisfactory",5,"2010",2
"Hotel_Alexander","If you're stuck in Zurich...","If you're stuck in Zurich any longer than one night you could find yourself in serious financial trouble. Luckily, we only had a day's stopover between trains across Europe in the no-fly week and booked this place through the [friendly and helpful] tourist office in the railway station. ""Prices are being continuously readjusted according to vacancies and demand"" reads the hotel's own rates leaflet. We were asked to pay upfront for the room before seeing it. Seemingly we paid a fixed price ""Guesthouse"" rate to stay in the Hotel as the guesthouse had possibly filled up with ash-stranded people booking directly with hotels whilst we were eating our lunch. The Guesthouse is round the corner and offers different decor and no breakfast for a cheaper rate. For whatever reason,",4,"2010",3
"Hotel_Alexander","Good value by Zurich standards","Zurich is a very expensive city and trying to find a value yet clean and comfortable hotel is not easy. The Alexander is situated 5 mins walk from Central station on a very lively side street. The hotel offers a variety of rooms which are clean comfortable and well appointed for a couple of nights stay. The day time staff were very very friendly and helpful - however the same could not be said for the night staff. Breakfast is the usual continental fare and was very acceptable. Noise from the street below may be an issue on occassion.",3,"2010",3
"Hotel_Alexander","Great location, good room, helpful friendly staff","Zurich is expensive, so just get over it. The Alexander hotel room I would give it a thumbs up. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The breakfast has a great selection. The room, pretty good. Location is of course excellent, very close to the Main Station in Zurich.",1,"2010",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Surprised by how helpful the staff was","The hotel is an EASY walk from the train station. The hotel has two buildings, the main on Niederforf and one, two star facility on the street in back. I stayed in the one in back and it was fine. Because it was two star, it was cheaper and it didn't have some of the amenities (like WiFi,) that the main hotel had but frankly the star system is highly over rated anyway, (no pun intended.) In my room, the bathroom was clean and the bed was comfortable. There was good lighting and enough electrical outlets to charge my numerous electronics. Internet was available for free if I went into the lobby which was a lot of fun because I could people watch. The staff was great. I was dreading Zurich because I was lugging 10 pounds of cheese from my ancestral valley and I",9,"2009",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Goo dplace to stay","Good place to stay! located in the center of the city and very easy to go to many points of interest. The most important thing... shopping places is just right in front of the hotel. However, it was a little bit far from the main station but it was not that bad if you walk without any suitcase. Close to many good restaurants and very easy to find something to eat. However, there were so many night clubs around the hotel so it was a little bit noisy and we needed to close the window. Lucky us that when we were there, the weather was nice so we were Ok with closing window without air conditioner. Also, the breakfast was as great as you satisfy with it and you can just walk for few minutes to go shopping. Nice room and good service, great place to stay!! The only bad thing is room",9,"2009",4

"Hotel_Alexander","Overpriced hotel for few services","This hotel was booked for me. The first big surprise it was not possible here to iron my clothes, either in the room or anywhere in the hotel. The offered to do it for me for 10 francs a shirt - $10. The room is spartan for the money with narrow single beds. The breakfast room is cramped and the hotel is without atmosphere. I suggest people shop around to find better value. Staff is friendly however.",11,"2008",2
"Hotel_Alexander","Pricey","Before I begin I must Mention that the hotel pricing in Switzerland is OUTRAGEOUS for the quality of room you get as a whole. Now that I have that done I can get on withe review. Based on the pricing around us I can say that the room we had which was in the Guesthouse & was located behind the Hotel was reasonably priced when compared to those around us. The room was OK but my wife wasn't to keen on the single beds being set up on opposite side of the room but they were comfortable. The only complaint we had was the street noise from the street below as we were near a nightclub. I had to open the window at night or else the room got stuffy. The actual location of the hotel relative to sightseeing was very good & it wa only a 5 minute walk to the train station that takes you to",10,"2008",3
"Hotel_Alexander","Central and cozy","We stayed in Alexander hotel with our little daughter for 2 dayes in May. Our no-smoking room on the upper floor was cozy, clean and had a nice view to the pedestrian street of Old town. As the weather was hot we were happy to have efficient air-condition in our room. Friendly receptionists and good cold buffet breakfast. The only thing we did not like was very boring porter who seeks tips too active. We can recommend this hotel as good central accomodation for reasonable price.",5,"2008",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Central location","Great location in the heart of old town with great access to cafes, the lake etc. A couple of strip clubs nearby on the same street add a little seediness to the area, but I found them to be not a problem the night we were there. The street it is located on is pedestrian access only so getting there by car is tricky but doable. The rooms are clean and neat, and the staff was nice. All in all it was a good stay.",8,"2006",4
"Hotel_Alexander","Decent hotel, clueless staff","I stayed in the main hotel section of this place for a few days in July. It's a genuine bargain for Switzerland (although if you're on a budget this is probably the wrong country in which to travel). Situated smack in the middle of town, we had a nice clean, cosy & quiet room at the back, with efficient, life-saving air-con, plenty of room & generally pleasing decor (although there was a picture of some English naval battle or other which may or not appeal). The one problem was the staff, who are friendly enough but don't seem to know what they're doing, and I got into a bit of a battle when leaving since they'd charged me for an extra night in June (for which I hadn't booked) on the grounds that I'd failed to show up! Only after my persistent refusal to pay for a further 3",8,"2006",3
"Hotel_Alexander","A very good hotel at a reasonable price!","I landed in this hotel during my recent visit to Zürich and was most surprised to find such a wonderful hotel at such reasonable prices. Given I was in Zürich during a high-occupancy time (watch convention, Zürich marathon, Spring Break, etc), the price wasn't through the roof. I say I landed here because I shopped around and this was the first hotel I found with three nights open at a reasonable price (150 SFR/night). The rooms all have WiFi internet access (purchased extra in blocks of time, but not expensive); the breakfast was par (free continental breakfast, charge for eggs and such); and the service was very comfortable. The hotel itself is located on Neiderdorfstraße, right in the heart of Old Town, and is an easy walk to Lake Zürich, the main trainstation, Bellvue,",4,"2005",4
